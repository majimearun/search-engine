Anyone who is entitled to benefits under any workers’ compensation law for the same injury. When you purchased this Part you were given the choice of either excluding yourself, or yourself and household members, from some or all of the PIP coverage. The portion of each claim you may have agreed not to be covered for is called a “deductible.” You paid a smaller premium if you chose a deductible. In that case, we will only pay up to the difference between $8,000 and the amount of your deductible. The deductible is shown on the Coverage Selections Page. If anyone is entitled to PIP benefits and also to benefits under another Part of this policy, we will pay from this Part first. We will not pay PIP benefits to or for an injured person, to the extent those benefits would duplicate expenses or losses recovered by that person in a court judgment or settlement. If anyone covered under this policy is also entitled to PIP benefits from any other auto policy, the total benefits payable will not be more than the highest amount payable under whichever one of the policies would have paid the most. In that case, each insurer will pay only its proportionate share. We will not pay benefits under this Part which duplicate payments made under the No-Fault coverage of any other auto policy. Part 3.
