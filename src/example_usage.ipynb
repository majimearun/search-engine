Business – means any full or part time activity from which any insured may derive an economic benefit, regardless of profit or loss. Business includes, but is not limited to, commercial enterprise, trade, hobby, profession, occupation or employment, or the renting, leasing or holding for rental or lease of any part of any premises by any insured. If an insured provides home day care services to a person or persons other than insureds and receives monetary or other compensation for such services, that activity is a business. Mutual exchange of home day care services, however, is not considered compensation. The rendering of home day care services by an insured to a relative of an insured is not considered a business. Depreciation - means the lessening of the economic value of any property because of age, wear and tear or obsolescence. Drug - means any controlled substance as defined by federal or state law. Drug includes but is not limited to cocaine, LSD, marijuana, methamphetamine and all narcotics. Electronic data processing equipment – means: 1. Computer hardware, including any: a. internal and external components; b. peripheral devices; and c. storage or recording media. 2. Computer software, meaning computer: a. programs; and b. applications. Fungi - means any type or form of fungus, including mold or mildew, and any mycotoxins, spores, scents or by-products produced or released by fungi.
