What Insurance is Required by Law
If you own an automobile that is operated on a highway in Ontario, certain insurance coverages are required
by law. You may also choose to buy additional insurance to extend these coverages to protect against other
risks. The chart below is only a general summary to give you an idea of the insurance coverages available
to you. For details of each coverage and the conditions that apply, you should consult the appropriate sections
of the policy. If there is a difference between the information in this chart and the appropriate section of the
policy, the section of the policy prevails.
You only have a specific coverage if your Certificate of Automobile Insurance shows a premium for it
or it is provided at no cost. If you have insured more than one automobile, a premium must be shown
for each automobile.

Section 1

Introduction
1.1

This Policy is Part of a Contract
This policy is part of a contract between you and us. The contract includes three documents:
 a completed and signed Application for Automobile Insurance,
 a Certificate of Automobile Insurance, and
 this policy.
Under the contract, we agree to provide you with the insurance that is summarized on your Certificate
of Automobile Insurance, and for which you have agreed to pay a premium.
You only have a particular coverage for a specific automobile if your Certificate of
Automobile Insurance shows a premium for it or shows the coverage is provided at no cost.

1.2

Where You Are Covered
This policy covers you and other insured persons for incidents occurring in Canada, the United States
of America and any other jurisdiction designated in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule, and on
a vessel travelling between ports of those countries. All of the dollar limits described in this policy are
in Canadian funds.

1.3

Definitions
Automobile
In this policy, motorized snow vehicle is included in the definition of automobile.
Regulations may include, or exclude, certain other types or classes of vehicles as automobiles.
In this policy, there is a difference between a described automobile and the automobile.
When we refer to an automobile as described, we mean any automobile specifically shown on
the Certificate of Automobile Insurance.

(OAP 1) Owner’s Policy
Page 1

When we refer to the automobile, we mean:


a described automobile,



a newly acquired automobile,



a temporary substitute automobile,



other automobiles driven by you, or driven by your spouse who lives with you, or



trailers, in certain circumstances.

These types of automobiles are described more fully in Section 2.
Certificate of Automobile Insurance
A Certificate of Automobile Insurance is a written document summarizing your insurance
coverage. It shows your name and/or organization, and the described automobile or
automobiles. It lists the coverages purchased, premiums charged, and the period during which
the insurance is in effect.
Covered/Coverage
When we talk of someone or something being covered, we mean that they are protected by
insurance. When we speak of coverage, we are describing what types of protection they have
and how much for each type.
Direct Loss or Damage
Direct loss or damage refers to damage or loss caused directly by a peril. This is different
than an indirect loss. For example, damage to an automobile resulting from a collision is a
direct loss. Loss of the use of an automobile while it is being repaired is an indirect loss.
Excluded Driver
An excluded driver is someone specifically not covered by this policy when driving the
described, temporary substitute or newly acquired automobile(s). The only exception is
coverage for those Accident Benefits the law requires to be paid to anyone injured in an
automobile accident in Ontario.
Named Insured
The named insured is the person or organization to whom the Certificate of Automobile
Insurance is issued.
Occupant
In this policy, an occupant is a person, including the driver, in or on an automobile, or getting
into, on, out of, or off an automobile.

Page 2

Proof of Loss Form
A proof of loss form records the formal statement concerning a loss for which a claim is
submitted. It provides us with all the information we need to determine whether the claim is
reasonable and the extent of our liability.
Spouse
Spouse means either of two persons who:


are married to each other;



have together entered into a marriage that is voidable or void, in good faith on the part
of the person making a claim under this policy; or



have lived together in a conjugal relationship outside marriage,
o continuously for a period of not less than three years, or
o in a relationship of some permanence, if they are the natural or adoptive parents
of a child.

We and You
Throughout this policy the words you and your refer to the person or organization shown on
the Certificate of Automobile Insurance as the named insured.
Other people may also be covered under certain conditions. We call both them and you
insured persons.
We, our and us mean the company providing the insurance.
1.4

Your Responsibilities
If you fail to meet your responsibilities, claims under this policy, with the
exception of certain Accident Benefits, may be denied.
By accepting this contract you agree to the following conditions.
1.4.1

You agree to notify us promptly in writing of any significant change of which you are
aware in your status as a driver, owner or lessee of a described automobile. You also
agree to let us know of any change that might increase the risk of an incident or affect our
willingness to insure you at current rates.
You must promptly tell us of any change in information supplied in your original
application for insurance, such as additional drivers, or a change in the way a described
automobile is used.

1.4.2

You agree to inform us of any sale or transfer of your interest in a described automobile
except through change of title by succession, death or proceedings under the Bankruptcy
and Insolvency Act (Canada).

If you have purchased optional Loss or Damage Coverages, you agree to inform us of any
new lien (an interest by others), mortgage or loan that affects a described automobile, as
well as any other insurance against loss or damage.

1.4.4

When you are involved in an auto accident involving injury or property damage, you need
to report it to your insurance agent, broker, or insurance company within seven days,
regardless of who is at fault. If you are unable to report the accident within seven days,
report it as soon as possible after that.

1.4.5

You agree not to drive or operate the automobile, or allow anyone else to drive or operate
the automobile, when not authorized by law.

1.4.6

You agree not to use or allow anyone to use the automobile in a race or speed test or for
any illegal trade or transportation.

1.4.7

Where to Make A Claim and Who May Make It
Warning – Offences
It is an offence under the Insurance Act to knowingly make a false or
misleading statement or representation to an insurer in connection with the
person’s entitlement to a benefit under a contract of insurance, or to
wilfully fail to inform the insurer of a material change in circumstances
within 14 days, in connection with such entitlement. The offence is
punishable on conviction by a maximum fine of $250,000 for the first
offence and a maximum fine of $500,000 for any subsequent conviction.
It is an offence under the federal Criminal Code for anyone to knowingly
make or use a false document with the intent it be acted on as genuine and
the offence is punishable, on conviction, by a maximum of 10 years
imprisonment.
It is an offence under the federal Criminal Code for anyone, by deceit,
falsehood, or other dishonest act, to defraud or to attempt to defraud an
insurance company. The offence is punishable, on conviction, by a
maximum of 14 years imprisonment for cases involving an amount over
$5,000 or otherwise a maximum of 2 years imprisonment.
You or other insured persons must notify us of a claim and provide proof of the claim. This may be
done in person or by registered mail addressed to our chief agent or head office in Ontario.
If you or other insured persons are unable to notify us or complete any required document for good
reason, someone may act on your behalf.
If you or other insured persons refuse, or are unable, to complete any required document, anyone to
whom any part of the insurance money is payable may do so instead.

1.6

Our Rights and Responsibilities
1.6.1

Payment of Claims
We will pay legitimate claims within 60 days of receiving a proof of loss. Some claims
for Accident Benefits will be paid sooner.
If we refuse to pay a claim, we will notify the insured person in writing explaining the
reasons why we are not liable to pay.

1.6.2

If You Have Been Incorrectly Classified and Your Premium is Wrong
We use rules that determine the amount you pay for each coverage and category of
automobile insurance. You are classified according to these rules.
If you have been incorrectly classified, we will correct the situation.
If the incorrect classification resulted in your paying too high a premium, we will refund
any premium overpayment with interest. The interest will cover the period for which you
were overcharged.
The rate of interest will be the bank rate, as set by the Bank of Canada, on the first day of
the last month of the quarter preceding the quarter in which you were incorrectly
classified. If the bank rate includes a fraction we will round it off to the next highest
number. (The bank rate is the rate at which the Bank of Canada makes short-term loans to
chartered banks.)
If the incorrect classification resulted in your paying too low a premium, we will require
you to pay an additional premium as long as we tell you within 60 days of the effective
date of the policy. We will not charge you interest on the additional premium.

1.6.3

Monthly Premium Payment Option
The law may allow you to pay your premium in equal monthly payments. If so, we may
charge you interest at a rate determined by the provincial government under the Insurance
Act (Ontario).

1.7

Cancelling Your Insurance
1.7.1

When You Cancel
You may cancel your insurance at any time by advising us.
If you cancel, we will calculate the premium you owe on a short rate basis. Short rate
means that the premium you owe will include our handling costs. We will refund
anything due to you as soon as possible.
There may be a minimum premium set out in your Certificate of Automobile Insurance.
This will not be refunded.

1.7.2

When We Cancel
Where your policy has been in effect for up to 60 days, we may only cancel your policy
for a reason that we have filed with the Financial Services Commission of Ontario.
Where your policy has been in effect for more than 60 days, we may only cancel your
policy for one of the following reasons:





non-payment of premium,
you have given false particulars of the automobile to our prejudice,
you have knowingly misrepresented or failed to disclose information that you were
required to provide in the application for automobile insurance, or
the risk has changed materially.

If we cancel your policy, we will calculate the premium you owe on a proportionate basis.
Proportionate means you will pay for the actual number of days you were covered. For
example, if half the premium period is over, you will pay half the premium.
There may be a minimum premium shown on your Certificate of Automobile Insurance.
This will not be refunded.
If you have paid more than the premium you owe, we will refund the difference on
cancellation. Your refund may be delayed if the amount of premium you owe is subject to
adjustment, or we are waiting for reports in order to determine the premium paid or owing.
We will make the refund as soon as possible in that case.

(OAP 1) Owner’s Policy

1.7.3

How We Can Cancel for Non-payment of Premium
In case of non-payment of premium, we may give you a notice in writing. We must give
you ten days notice if we deliver the notice in person, or 30 days notice by sending the
notice by registered mail to your last known address. The 30-day period starts on the
second day after we mail the registered letter. The notice will inform you that you have
until noon of the business day before the last day of the notice period to pay the arrears,
plus an administration fee, failing which the policy will automatically be cancelled
effective at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the notice period. If you pay the arrears and the
administration fee in time, then your policy will not be cancelled.
But if we have already given you two notices of non-payment of premium during the term
of your policy and a non-payment occurs again, we don’t have to give you another notice
under this section; instead we may cancel your policy as described in section 1.7.4.

1.7.4

How We Can Cancel for Repeated Non-payment or Other Reasons
If we cancel your insurance for non-payment of premium because we have already given
you two notices during the term of your policy as described in section 1.7.3, or if we
cancel for any other reason, we will notify you in writing. We must give you five days
notice if we deliver the notice of cancellation in person, or 15 days notice by sending the
notice of cancellation by registered mail to your last known address. The 15-day period
starts on the second day after we mail the registered letter. If the notice was given because
we have already given you two notices of non-payment during the term of your policy as
described in section 1.7.3, we are under no obligation to accept a late payment or to keep
the policy in force after the effective date of cancellation.

A newly acquired automobile is an automobile or trailer that you acquire as owner and
that is not covered under any other policy. It can be either a replacement or an additional

anyone insured by this policy, because of its breakdown, repair, servicing, theft, sale or
destruction.
Coverage for a temporary substitute automobile is provided under the automobile policy

When You Have Insured Two Or More Automobiles
2.3.1

Under the Same Policy
When more than one automobile is described on your Certificate of Automobile Insurance,
we will treat each automobile as if it were insured by a separate policy for claims resulting
from its use or operation.
However, in the case of an incident involving an automobile you don't own, we will only
pay up to the highest limit that applies to any one automobile described in this policy.
Example

Your automobile policy has Liability Coverage on two automobiles for $300,000 and
$500,000 respectively. If you are driving someone else's automobile and are involved
in an accident, the most we would pay is $500,000.
2.3.2

Under More Than One Policy
When you have two or more automobiles insured as described automobiles under two or
more policies, each automobile will be covered by its respective policy.
However, determining how much we will pay is more complicated if there is an incident in
an automobile you don't own.
The amount we will pay under this policy for any incident will be a fraction of the highest
policy limit. This fraction will be the proportion that the limit under this policy bears to
the total of the limits of all the policies.
In no case will we pay more than this proportion of the highest limit.

Effective (2016-06-01)
FSCO (1215E.2)

(OAP 1) Owner’s Policy
Page 15

Example
You have an automobile with Liability Coverage for $200,000 under this policy
(Policy A) and another automobile with Liability Coverage for $300,000 under a
separate policy (Policy B). If you have an accident while driving an automobile you
don't own, here is how we will calculate the amount we will pay.
Step 1. What is the total of the limits of all the policies?

+

200,000 (limit under Policy A)
300,000 (limit under Policy B)
500,000 (total under both policies)

Step 2. What is the proportion of the limit under Policy A to the total from Step 1?
200,000 (limit under Policy A)
500,000 (total under both policies)

=

2
5

Step 3. What is the most we will pay under this policy?
2 x 300,000 (highest policy limit)
5

=

120,000

The most we would pay would be 2/5 of the loss, but never more than $120,000, 2/5
of the highest policy limit. The other policy will pay the remaining 3/5 of the loss to
a maximum of $180,000.
2.4

Trailers and Towing
2.4.1

Trailers
An automobile pulling one or more trailers will be treated as a single automobile when
determining how much we will pay under Liability, Accident Benefits and Uninsured
Automobile Coverages. However, they will be treated as separate automobiles when
determining the deductibles and how much we will pay under Direct Compensation Property Damage and optional Loss or Damage Coverages.

2.4.2

Automobiles in Tow
We may inspect the automobile at any reasonable time. If you do not co-operate in any
incident involving two or more automobiles owned by different persons and attached to each
other, the insurer of each automobile will compensate its insured for losses according to the
terms of the Direct Compensation - Property Damage and optional Loss or Damage
coverages.

arrangements for inspection, your optional Loss or Damage Coverages under Section 7 may be
cancelled and any claims under that Section may be denied.

Section 3

Liability Coverage
You only have a particular coverage for a specific automobile if your Certificate
of Automobile Insurance shows a premium for it or shows the coverage is
provided at no cost.
3.1

Introduction
This Section of your policy provides coverage for amounts that the law holds you or other insured
persons responsible for bodily injuries or losses others suffer in an automobile incident.

3.2

Who is Covered
You are covered when you, or anyone else in possession of a described automobile with your consent,
uses or operates it. We will consider these other people insured persons.
Your Liability Coverage applies when you or others use or operate certain other
types of automobiles. See Section 2 for details and additional conditions.

3.3

What We Cover
You or other insured persons may be legally responsible for the bodily injury to, or death of others, or
for damage to the property of others as a result of owning, leasing or operating the automobile or
renting or leasing another automobile. In these cases, we will make any payment on your or other
insured persons' behalf that the law requires, up to the limits of the policy.
We will also reimburse anyone covered by this policy for costs involved in providing immediate
medical aid needed by someone hurt in an automobile incident.
When we receive notice of loss or damage caused to persons or property we will investigate. We may
then negotiate a settlement on behalf of you or other insured persons.
3.3.1

If Someone Sues You
By accepting this policy you and other insured persons irrevocably appoint us to act on your or
their behalf in any lawsuit against you or them in Canada, the United States of America or any
other jurisdiction designated in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule arising out of the
ownership, use or operation of the automobile.

Effective (2016-06-01)

(OAP 1) Owner’s Policy
Page 18

If someone sues you or other insured persons insured by this Section for losses suffered in an
automobile incident, we will provide a defence and cover the costs of that defence, including
investigation costs. We will pay all legal costs the court assesses against you and other insured
persons in the lawsuit we have defended.
If there is a judgment against you or other insured persons, we will pay any post-judgment
interest owed on that part of the amount the court orders that falls within the liability limits of
your policy.
We reserve the right to investigate, negotiate and settle any claim out of court if we choose.
If you are sued for more than the limits of your policy, you may wish to hire, at your
cost, your own lawyer to protect yourself against the additional risk.
3.3.2

How Much We Will Pay
The most we will pay on your behalf and on behalf of all other insured persons insured by this
Section, for any one incident (over and above legal costs and post-judgment interest) will be
determined by the extent of your coverage. The limit under your policy is shown on the
Certificate of Automobile Insurance.
Example
You are sued for injuries suffered by another person in an accident that you are
legally responsible for. We will hire lawyers at our expense and cover all costs of
your defence in court.
The court orders you to pay $10,000 in costs and $600,000 to cover losses. Your
liability limit is $500,000.
We will cover the $10,000 in costs, and $500,000 of the judgment. We will also pay
any interest owed on that amount from the day of the judgment. You will be
responsible for the remaining $100,000 of the judgment and any interest owed on
that.

(OAP 1) Owner’s Policy
Page 19

3.3.3

Outside Ontario
If the incident happens in a jurisdiction covered by this policy in which the minimum liability
coverage required is higher than the limit shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance,
we will honour the higher amount. We also agree not to use any legal defence that would not
be available if the policy had been issued in that jurisdiction.
Example
You have an accident in a province where the minimum liability coverage required is
$500,000. Even though you are only carrying $200,000 worth of liability insurance,
we will pay up to $500,000.

3.3.4

If There is More Than One Named Insured Under This Policy
We will protect you and others named as insured by this policy, for claims made against each
other. In such cases, we will act as if a separate policy was issued to each named insured.
However, the total amount we will pay (over and above legal costs and post-judgment interest)
cannot exceed the maximum coverage shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance.
Example
Two people are in business together. Both are named in the insurance policy covering
their van. They have bought Liability Coverage of $500,000.
One day, there is an accident while one is driving and the other is a passenger. Both
of them are severely injured as a result of their combined negligence.
They sue each other and one is awarded $300,000 and the other $500,000. The
combined amount we will pay will not be more than the policy limit of $500,000 plus
legal costs and post-judgment interest.

3.3.5

Rented and Leased Automobiles
For convenience in this subsection we use the terms rent, renter and rented as equivalent to
lease, lessee and leased.
This policy provides coverage for persons who rent an automobile, as described in the
definitions of automobile in Section 2, as a result of liability imposed by law arising from the
negligence of the driver of that automobile.

(OAP 1) Owner’s Policy
Page 20

If a liability claim is made against a driver, renter or owner of a rented automobile, coverage
may be available under more than one motor vehicle liability policy. The following rules
govern the order in which the policies will respond:
1.

If insurance is available to the person who rented the automobile, the policy providing
that insurance responds first.

2.

If insurance is available to the driver of the rented automobile, the policy providing that
insurance responds next.

3.

If insurance is available to the owner of the rented automobile, the policy providing that
insurance responds last.

We have no liability for such claims in excess of the limit of liability coverage specified in the
Certificate of Automobile Insurance and do not have the responsibility to defend such claims
against anyone other than you, your spouse who lives with you, or the persons mentioned in
subsections 2.2.3 (6) and 2.2.4 (6).
Example #1*
You rent a car and your friend is driving it when an accident occurs in Ontario. You,
your friend, and the rental company may face claims by other people who have
sustained a loss in the accident. If insurance is available to you under your policy for
such claims and your friend was at fault for the accident, then your policy would be
first in line to pay those people. If that coverage were used up, and if insurance is
available to your friend under his or her policy, your friend’s insurer would pay next.
If that coverage were used up, any insurance available under the rental company’s
policy would then pay. None of the insurers has to pay more than the limit of
coverage that it agreed to provide.
Example #2*
Your friend rents a car and you are driving it when an accident occurs in Ontario.
You, your friend, and the rental company may face claims by other people who have
sustained a loss in the accident. If you were at fault for the accident and insurance is
available to your friend under his or her policy for such claims, then your friend’s
insurer would be first in line to pay those people. If that coverage were used up, and if
insurance is available to you under your policy, then your insurer would pay next. If
that coverage were used up, any insurance available under the rental company’s

*These examples are provided as a convenience only, to illustrate the operation of section 277 of the Insurance Act (Ontario). If
there is a discrepancy between section 277 and these examples, section 277 prevails. In addition, whether or not insurance is
available under a policy in any given situation depends on the facts of that situation and the terms of the particular policy.

policy would then pay. None of the insurers has to pay more than the limit of
coverage that it agreed to provide.
3.4

Your and Other Insured Persons' Responsibilities
You and other insured persons agree:


to notify us in writing within seven days of any incident involving loss or damage to persons
or property (or, if unable because of incapacity, as soon as possible after that), giving us full
details of the incident and any claim arising from it;



if requested, to give us a statutory declaration that the claim arose out of the use or operation of
the automobile and that you or other insured persons were using, operating or responsible for
the operation of it;



to help us obtain all necessary information and evidence about the incident, including the
attendance of witnesses, and to cooperate, but not financially, in any legal actions if we ask;



to send immediately to us everything received in writing concerning the claim, including legal
documents; and



not to assume any liability for the incident, or settle any claim, except at your or other insured
persons' own cost, and not to interfere in any legal proceeding or in any negotiations we
conduct to settle any claim.

We may, on occasion, be required by law to make payments, even though we are not otherwise
liable for them under this policy. If so, you or other insured persons will have to reimburse us
upon demand for those payments.
3.5

Other Limitations On Your Coverage
3.5.1

Property Not Covered
Under this Section, we won't cover claims for damage to property carried in or upon the
automobile, or claims for damage to other property owned or rented by, or in the care,
custody or control of you or other insured persons.

3.5.2

Contamination of Property
Under this Section, we won't cover claims arising from contamination of property carried
in the automobile.

Nuclear Hazards
Nuclear energy hazards means radioactive, toxic, explosive or other hazardous properties
of substances described in Regulations made under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act
(Canada).
If you or other insured persons are involved in an incident where the loss or damage is
directly or indirectly caused by a nuclear hazard, we will pay up to $200,000 if you or
other insured persons are covered under this policy for a nuclear hazard and you and
other insured persons are also insured under a nuclear energy hazard liability policy. We
will only pay after the limits of that policy have been paid out.

Assessment of Attendant Care Needs form.
If you or another insured person is claiming the Medical Benefit or Rehabilitation Benefit,
your doctor or another member of a regulated health profession including a social worker must
provide us with a treatment and assessment plan or other related forms.
In some cases, we can ask you or other insured persons to go for an independent assessment to
assess your needs.
We may ask you or other insured persons to provide additional information in connection with
the claim, such as a statutory declaration as to the circumstances that gave rise to the
application, or proof of identity. We can also ask you or other insured persons to attend an
examination under oath in connection with entitlement to benefits, on reasonable advance
notice and at a time and place that are convenient to the person. If the person does not
participate as requested, benefits may be delayed or suspended.
If the injuries fall within certain guidelines issued by the Superintendent of Financial Services,
you or other insured persons may be entitled to some medical or rehabilitation treatments
without our prior approval and before a completed application is submitted.

Section 5

Uninsured Automobile Coverage
You only have a particular coverage for a specific automobile if your
Certificate of Automobile Insurance shows a premium for it or shows the
coverage is provided at no cost.

5.1

Introduction
5.1.1 Uninsured Automobile Coverage Schedule
This Section of the policy describes the terms and conditions of the coverage set out in the
Uninsured Automobile Coverage Schedule under the Insurance Act (Ontario). If there is a
difference between the interpretation of the wording of this Section and the interpretation of the
wording in the Schedule, the Schedule prevails. However, 5.3.3 in this Section is an addition to
the coverage provided by the Schedule.
5.1.2 What is an Uninsured Automobile?
An uninsured automobile is one for which neither the owner nor driver has liability insurance to
cover bodily injury or property damage arising out of its ownership, use or operation, or the
insurance is not collectible. However, this does not include an automobile owned by or
registered in the name of the insured person or their spouse.
5.1.3 What is an Unidentified Automobile?
An unidentified automobile is one whose owner or driver cannot be determined.

5.2

What We Will Cover
5.2.1 Claims by You or Other Insured Persons for Bodily Injury
We will pay any amounts you or other insured persons have a legal right to recover as damages
from the owner or driver of an uninsured or unidentified automobile for bodily injury resulting
from an accident involving an automobile, up to the limits in this Section.

We will pay any amounts any person has a legal right to recover as damages from the owner or
driver of an uninsured or unidentified automobile for bodily injury or death of an insured person
in an accident involving an automobile, up to the limits in this Section.
5.2.3 Claims for Certain Property Damage
We will pay for damage to and for loss of use of the automobile or its contents, or to both, that
you or other insured persons have a legal right to recover from the identified owner or driver of
an uninsured automobile in an accident involving an automobile. Subject to the $300
deductible, we will pay up to $25,000.
Note: Damage to the automobile caused by an unidentified automobile is
not covered under this Section, but optional Loss or Damage Coverages
may be available.
5.3

Claims for Bodily Injury or Death
5.3.1 Who is Covered?
The following are insured persons for bodily injury or death:


Any person who is an occupant of the automobile.



You, your spouse, and any dependent relative of you or your spouse,
o when an occupant of an uninsured automobile, or
o when not in an automobile, streetcar or railway vehicle if hit by an unidentified
or uninsured automobile.



If you are a corporation, unincorporated association or partnership, any director,
officer, employee or partner for whose regular use the described automobile is provided,
their spouse, and any dependent relative of you or your spouse,
o when occupants of an uninsured automobile; or
o when not in an automobile, streetcar or railway vehicle if hit by an unidentified
or uninsured automobile.

Note: If the director, officer, employee or partner, or their spouse is the owner
of an automobile that is insured, this policy does not apply. The policy of that
automobile will provide coverage.

A dependent relative who owns an insured automobile, or who suffers bodily injury or death
while an occupant of his or her own uninsured automobile, is not covered under this Section of
your policy.
5.3.3 If the Described Automobile is Leased or Rented
If this policy has been changed to allow the rental or lease of the described automobile for more
than 30 days, the person or organization who is the lessee of the automobile is treated as the
named insured.
5.3.4 Conditions Applying to Claims for Bodily Injury or Death
A person entitled to claim compensation for the bodily injury or death of an insured person
must:


give us written notice of the claim within 30 days of the accident or, if unable, as soon as
possible after that.



provide us with as much evidence as possible in support of the claim, giving details of
the accident and the resulting loss. This should be done within 90 days of the accident or,
if unable, as soon as possible after that.



provide us with a certificate from the medical or psychological advisor of the insured
person if we request it. The certificate must state the cause of injury or death and, if

under which there is a right to compensation.

5.3.5 Accidents Involving Unidentified Automobiles

person or their representative must report the accident within 24 hours, or, if unable, as soon as
possible after that, to a police officer or similar authority.
You or other insured persons must give us a written statement within 30 days of the accident, or,
if unable, as soon as possible after that, giving a detailed description of what happened. A
representative can make the statement. The statement must say whether the accident was caused
by someone whose identity cannot be determined. It must also detail the extent of the injuries
suffered by you or other insured persons and any property damaged in the accident. The
automobile in which you or other insured persons were an occupant at the time of the accident
must be available for inspection at our request.

5.3.6 Medical Examinations May Be Required
You or other insured persons may be required to undergo examinations by a qualified medical
or psychological advisor at reasonable intervals. When we require an examination, we will give
reasonable notice.
We will pay for any examination we require. The person making the claim, or their
representative, is entitled to a copy of the medical report, if requested.
5.4

Claims for Property Damage
5.4.1 Who is Covered?
In a claim for damage to the automobile, the owner of the automobile is covered for damage.
In a claim for damage to the contents of the automobile, the owner of the contents is covered for
damage.
5.4.2 Conditions Applying to Claims for Property Damage
When making a claim for property damage, you and other insured persons must:


notify us in writing within seven days of the accident (or, if unable because of
incapacity, as soon as possible after that), giving us the best information available at that
time concerning the loss or damage and circumstances.



do as much as is reasonably possible to protect the automobile from further damage. We
will pay for any reasonable protection provided. Further damage resulting from failure
to provide reasonable protection will not be covered by this policy.



make no repairs beyond those needed for protection of the automobile, or remove
evidence of the damage, without our written consent or until we have had time to inspect
the automobile.



allow us to copy all documents in your or other insured persons' possession that relate to
the accident.



permit us to inspect the automobile at any reasonable time.



complete a statutory declaration within 90 days of the accident, if requested. The
declaration will describe what happened in detail, the cause and amount of the loss, those
affected and how, and state that the loss was truly accidental. We will also need to know
if any other insurance is involved.



not leave us to dispose of the automobile unless we agree to accept it. If we decide to
replace the automobile or pay its actual cash value, less the deductible specified in your
Certificate of Automobile Insurance, we own the salvage.

(OAP 1) Owner’s Policy
Page 31

5.4.3 Our Right to Repair, Replace or Rebuild the Automobile
We have the right to repair, replace or rebuild the automobile rather than pay for the damage. If
we choose to do this, we will let you or other insured persons know in writing within seven days
of receiving notice of the claim. We will complete the work within a reasonable time using
parts of similar kind and quality.
5.4.4 How Much We Will Pay
The most we will pay for the automobile is its actual cash value at the time it was damaged, less
the deductible specified in your Certificate of Automobile Insurance.
The value of the loss or damage is based on actual cash value after taking into account
depreciation. We will not pay more to repair the automobile than its actual cash value at the time
it was damaged, less the deductible specified in your Certificate of Automobile Insurance.
We will pay the lower of the following:



the cost to repair the loss or damage, less the deductible; or
the actual cash value of the automobile at the time it was damaged, less the applicable
deductible.
Example

Your car is four years old and is hit on the front left side by an identified but
uninsured automobile. The damaged part of the body of your car is repaired.
We will pay the cost of the repairs, less the $300 deductible, including new
paint for the damaged part of your automobile. If you want the entire car
repainted, you will have to pay the cost of painting the rest of the car.
5.5

Claims for Both Bodily Injury and Property Damage
An accident may result in a valid claim for both bodily injury or death and for damage to the
automobile or its contents. In that case, payments for bodily injury and death have priority on 95% of
the total amount payable. Payment for damage to the automobile or contents will have priority on 5%.
Example
An accident in Ontario for which an identified but uninsured driver is
responsible destroys your $20,000 car, and results in injuries to you and your
spouse, totalling $350,000.
We will not pay more than the minimum liability limit of $200,000. Of that
money, 95%, or $190,000, will go toward payment for bodily injury. The

Effective (2016-06-01)
FSCO (1215E.2)

(OAP 1) Owner’s Policy
Page 32

remaining 5%, or $10,000, will apply to the loss of your car.
5.6

Settling a Claim
5.6.1 By Agreement
Questions about whether a claim is valid, and the amount of any payment, can be decided by
agreement between us and you or other insured persons making the claim.
5.6.2 By Arbitration
If there is a disagreement, the matter may be settled by arbitration if you or other insured
persons ask for it or if we ask for it and you agree. The arbitrator will be an individual
acceptable to us and you or other insured persons. If both sides can't agree on an arbitrator, then
each side will name an arbitrator. The two arbitrators will then appoint a third. A decision
supported by at least two of the three will be binding. All arbitrations will be governed by the
Arbitration Act, 1991 (Ontario).
5.6.3 In Court
The matter may be decided in a lawsuit brought against us by you or other insured persons in an
Ontario court. If so, we have the right to ask the court to decide who is legally responsible and
the amount of compensation owing, unless another Ontario court has already done so in an
action that was defended.

5.7

Limitations and Exceptions
5.7.1 Payment Limits
1.

We will not pay more than the minimum limits for automobile liability insurance in
the jurisdiction in which the accident happens. This amount applies regardless of the
number of persons injured or killed, or the damage to the automobile and contents.
In no event will we pay more than the minimum liability limits required in Ontario.
Example

You are travelling in a car outside Ontario when you are injured in an accident
for which an uninsured driver is responsible. The minimum liability limit in that
jurisdiction is $100,000. Your injuries are serious and are assessed at $300,000
or more. We will pay no more than $100,000.

contents.



any amount over $25,000 in any one accident for damage to the automobile

driving the automobile.

5.7.2 Limit Where More Than One Policy Applies
You or other insured persons may have a right to claim benefits from more than one automobile
insurance policy covering accidents involving uninsured or unidentified automobiles. In that
case, anyone making a claim under this or any other coverage may only recover once for the
same loss.
5.8

If You or Other Insured Persons Start a Lawsuit
5.8.1 Send Us the Documents
You or other insured persons or your representatives may decide to sue the owner, driver or
operator of another automobile involved in the accident. In that case, a copy of the documents
initiating the lawsuit must be provided to us as soon as the action is started. The documents must
be delivered, or sent by registered mail, to our chief agent or head office in Ontario.
5.8.2 If You or Other Insured Persons Win, But Can't Recover Payment
If the court awards compensation but you or other insured persons can't recover from the person
responsible, we will pay, if requested, either:


the full amount of the award; or



where some compensation has been paid, the difference between what you or other
insured persons have been paid and the full amount awarded by the court.

What we pay, of course, is subject to the limits and conditions applying to coverage for
accidents involving uninsured or unidentified automobiles.
5.8.3 Assignment of the Award
We may require you or other insured persons, or your representatives, to assign to us the amount
or balance of the court award before we make any payment. If we collect more than what we
have already paid, we will reimburse the difference, minus our costs.
5.9

Limitations on Legal Action
5.9.1 Conditions of This Policy Must be Met
No person has a right to sue us for compensation under this Section for injury or damage caused
by an accident involving an uninsured or unidentified automobile, unless the conditions in this
Section of your policy (Uninsured Automobile Coverage) have been met.
5.9.2 Time Limits for Lawsuits for Loss or Damage
Any lawsuit against us regarding loss or damage to the automobile or its contents must begin
within a year after the loss or damage happens.
Any lawsuit against us regarding loss or damage to property other than the automobile and its
contents must begin within two years after the cause of action arose.
5.9.3 Time Limits for Lawsuits for Bodily Injury or Death
Any lawsuit against us regarding bodily injury or death must begin within two years after the

Section 6

Direct Compensation - Property Damage Coverage
You only have a particular coverage for a specific automobile if your
Certificate of Automobile Insurance shows a premium for it or shows the
coverage is provided at no cost.
6.1

Introduction
This Section of your policy covers damage to the automobile and certain trailers not shown on the
Certificate of Automobile Insurance, their equipment, contents, and loss of use of the automobile or
contents caused by another person's use or operation of an automobile in Ontario.
The coverage under this Section applies only if the accident takes place in Ontario and at least one
other automobile involved is insured under a motor vehicle liability policy. The policy covering the
other automobile must be issued by an insurance company licensed in Ontario, or one that has filed
with the Financial Services Commission of Ontario to provide this coverage.
It is called direct compensation because you will collect from us, your insurance company, even
though you, or anyone else using or operating the automobile with your consent, were not entirely at
fault for the accident.

6.2

What We Will Cover
We will pay the cost of damage to the automobile, its equipment, contents and for loss of use of the
automobile or contents arising from an accident for which another person would have been legally
responsible in the absence of section 263 of the Insurance Act (Ontario). Section 263 takes away your
right to sue the other person for these losses. We will pay no more to repair or replace the automobile
or property than its actual cash value at the time it was damaged, less the applicable percentage of the
deductible shown on your Certificate of Automobile Insurance.
If a part needed to repair the automobile is no longer available, we will pay an amount equal to the
manufacturer's latest list price for the part.
Note: You should be aware that this coverage does not apply if the automobile is described in
another motor vehicle liability policy.

(OAP 1) Owner’s Policy
Page 36

Example
You are driving a friend's car. That car is described in your friend's motor
vehicle liability policy. You have an accident for which you are not at fault.
Your friend will claim under the direct compensation property damage
provisions of his or her motor vehicle liability policy for the loss.
We will not pay for damage to, or loss of use of, contents that are being carried for reward.
6.3

Who is Covered
In a claim for damage to the automobile, the owner of the automobile is covered for damage.
In a claim for damage to the contents of the automobile, the owner of the contents is covered for
damage.

6.4

How Much We Will Pay
6.4.1 Determining Fault
The amount we pay under this Section of your policy will be determined by the degree to
which you or the driver were not at fault in the accident.
Responsibility for an accident is determined by the Insurance Act (Ontario) and the Fault
Determination Rules. These may find you or the driver wholly or partially responsible.
The degree of responsibility is expressed as a percentage.
6.4.2 The Deductible
The amount we pay may be subject to a Direct Compensation - Property Damage deductible.
The deductible is the amount you agree to pay toward the cost of any single claim you make
under this Section. The deductible, if any, is the amount shown on the Certificate of
Automobile Insurance, multiplied by the percentage to which you or the driver of the
automobile were not at fault for the accident. You are not permitted to sue anyone (for
instance the at-fault motorist) to recover this deductible.
If you have damage to both your automobile and its contents, the deductible will first be
applied to your automobile loss. If there is any remaining deductible, the remainder will be
applied to the contents loss.
You will need to make a separate claim for each accident that causes damage. The deductible
applies each time you make a claim and separately to each automobile that is insured.

Effective (2016-06-01)
FSCO (1215E.2)

(OAP 1) Owner’s Policy
Page 37

We will pay that portion of the total damages that is equal to the percentage to which you or
the driver of the automobile were not at fault for the accident, less the applicable Direct
Compensation-Property Damage deductible.
Example #1
(the other driver is entirely responsible)
Your car has an actual cash value of $12,000. You are involved in an accident
for which someone else is 100% responsible. Your car is a total loss.
Your Direct Compensation - Property Damage (DC-PD) deductible is $500.
We will pay $11,500 ($12,000 less $500, the deductible). We will also pay for
reasonable alternate transportation.
In sum: You receive $11,500. You are responsible for $500, the DC-PD
deductible.
Example #2
(you are partly responsible - no optional Loss or Damage Coverages)
Your car has an actual cash value of $12,000. You are involved in an accident
and are 25% responsible. Your car is a total loss.
Your Direct Compensation - Property Damage (DC-PD) deductible is $300.
Under DC-PD, we cover the damages (less the deductible) for which the other
driver would have otherwise been responsible. You are responsible for the
deductible. We will pay $8,775 ($9,000 -- being 75% of the value of your
automobile -- less $225 -- being 75% of the deductible).
In sum: You receive $8,775. You are responsible for $225 (the DC-PD
deductible), and will have to pay the remainder out of your own pocket. In this
example, you will be out-of-pocket for a total of $3,225. (However, you may be
entitled to recover part of that amount if you have bought additional optional
Loss or Damage coverages under Section 7.)

Example #3
(damage to contents)
Suppose you have just rented a floor sander currently worth $600 from the local
Rent-All when you are involved in an accident. You are 25% responsible for
the accident. The sander is destroyed.
Your Direct Compensation – Property Damage (DC-PD) deductible is $500.
We will pay $75 ($450 – being 75% of the value of the sander – less $375 –
being 75% of the deductible.)
In sum: You will receive $75. You are responsible for $375 (the DC-PD
deductible), and that portion of the damage for which you are responsible.
Example #4
(damage to automobile and contents)
You are involved in an accident for which you are not responsible. The repair of
your car costs $250. Contents worth $125 are destroyed.
Your Direct Compensation - Property Damage (DC-PD) deductible is $300. We
will pay $0 ($250 less $250) toward your car damage, and $75 ($125 less $50)
for the contents to the owner of the contents.
In sum: The owner of the contents receives $75. You are responsible for $300,
the DC-PD deductible.
6.5

Your and Other Insured Persons' Responsibilities
When making a claim for property damage, you and other insured persons must:


notify us in writing within seven days of any accident (or, if unable, because of incapacity, as
soon as possible after that), giving us the best information available at that time concerning the
loss or damage and circumstances.



do as much as is reasonably possible to protect the automobile from further damage. We will
pay for any reasonable protection provided. Further damage resulting from failure to provide
reasonable protection will not be covered by this policy.



make no repairs beyond those needed for protection of the automobile, or remove evidence of
the damage, without our written consent or until we have had time to inspect the automobile.
allow us to copy all documents in your or other insured persons' possession that relate to the
accident.



permit us to inspect the automobile at any reasonable time.



complete a statutory declaration within 90 days of the accident, if requested. The declaration
will describe what happened in detail, the cause and amount of the loss, those affected and
how, and state that the loss was truly accidental. We will also need to know if any other
insurance is involved.



not leave us to dispose of the automobile unless we agree to accept it. If we decide to replace
the automobile or pay its actual cash value, less the applicable deductible, we own the salvage.

Our Right to Repair, Replace or Rebuild the Automobile
We have the right to repair, replace or rebuild the automobile rather than pay for the damage. If we
choose to do this, we will let you or other insured persons know in writing within seven days of
receiving notice of the claim. We will complete the work within a reasonable time using parts of
similar kind and quality.

6.7

Other Limitations on Your Coverage
6.7.1 Contamination of Property
Under this Section, we won't cover claims arising from contamination of property carried in
the automobile.
6.7.2 Nuclear Hazards
Nuclear energy hazards means radioactive, toxic, explosive or other hazardous properties of
substances described in Regulations made under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (Canada).
If you or other insured persons are involved in an accident where the loss or damage is directly
or indirectly caused by a nuclear hazard, we will pay up to $200,000 if you or other insured
persons are covered under this policy for a nuclear hazard and you or other insured persons are
also insured under a nuclear energy hazard liability policy. We will only pay after the limits of
that policy have been paid out.
6.7.3 Settling a Claim
If you disagree with the degree of fault attributed to you under the Fault Determination Rules
or with the amount of any proposed settlement, you can bring a law suit against us to have the
matter determined by a judge.
Alternatively, if the disagreement is over the value of the vehicle or its contents or the nature,
amount or cost of any repairs or the amount we should pay, the matter can be settled by an
appraisal under the Insurance Act, if you ask for it or if we ask for it and you agree. You and
we will each appoint an appraiser, who will either agree on the award or, if they disagree, will
appoint an umpire to decide as between their respective positions.

co-operate with any reasonable arrangements for inspection, your coverages under this Section
may be cancelled and any claims under this Section may be denied.

Example
We will not pay for a tire blow-out in normal driving, but if the tire is destroyed
in a collision and you have Collision or Upset Coverage, we will cover that loss
up to the value of your tire at the time of the incident.
We won't pay for loss or damage:


resulting from a dishonest claim of ownership, illegal disposal, or theft of the
automobile by anyone who has legal possession of it under a written agreement (a
mortgage, conditional sale, lease or other similar agreement);



resulting from a change in ownership that is agreed to, even if that change was brought
about by trickery or fraud;
Example

Late one evening at a party, you sell your car to a stranger in return for a
cheque. A week later the cheque bounces. We will not cover the loss.

7.2.2



caused by radioactive contamination;



to contents of automobiles and trailers, other than their equipment; and



in excess of $25 for recorded material and equipment for use with a playing or
recording unit. We will not pay for recorded material and equipment not contained
within or attached to the playing or recording unit. Recorded material includes, but is
not limited to, tapes, compact discs, video cassettes and digital video discs.

Illegal Use
We won't pay for loss or damage caused in an incident:


if you are unable to maintain proper control of the automobile because you are driving
or operating the automobile while under the influence of intoxicating substances;



if you are convicted of one of the following offences under the Criminal Code of
Canada relating to the operation, care or control of the automobile, or committed by
means of an automobile, or any similar offence under any law in Canada or the United
States:
o causing bodily harm by criminal negligence
o dangerous operation of motor vehicles



7.2.3

o operation of motor vehicle when impaired or with more than 80 mg of alcohol

if you use or permit the automobile to be used in a race or speed test, or for illegal
activity;



if you drive the automobile while not authorized by law; and



if another person, with your permission, drives or operates the automobile under any of
these conditions.

Certain Thefts Not Covered
We won't pay under either the Comprehensive or Specified Perils coverages for loss or
damage caused when a person who lives in your household steals the automobile.
We also won't pay under these coverages for loss or damage caused when an employee of
yours steals the automobile and the employee's duties include driving, maintaining or repairing
the automobile. This applies at any time, and not simply during working hours.

7.3

The Deductible
The amount we pay to cover any losses may be subject to a deductible. The deductible is the amount
you agree to pay toward the cost of any single claim you make under this Section. The deductible, if
any, is shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance.
You will need to make a separate claim for each incident that causes loss or damage. The deductible
applies each time you make a claim and separately to each automobile that is insured.
We will only pay for loss or damage that exceeds the amount of the deductible. If your claim is one to
which Section 6, Direct Compensation - Property Damage (DC-PD) Coverage also applies, the
amount we will pay under this Section will not include the DC-PD deductible that applies to the
claim. Your deductible under this Section will be the Collision deductible multiplied by the
percentage to which you or the driver of the automobile were at fault for the accident.
Example #1
You have Comprehensive Coverage, and your deductible is $500. Your car's
windshield is broken by a fallen tree. You are responsible for the first $500 of
the cost of the windshield replacement. Any claim less than $500 will be your
responsibility.

Example #2
(you are fully responsible - with optional Loss or Damage Coverages)
Your car has an actual cash value of $12,000. You are involved in an accident
and are 100% responsible. Your car is a total loss.
You receive nothing under your Direct Compensation - Property Damage
Coverage.
You have the optional Collision or Upset Coverage and your deductible is $500.
Under the optional coverage, we will pay $11,500 ($12,000 less $500, the
deductible).
In sum: You receive $11,500. You are responsible for $500, the Collision
deductible.

Example #3
(you are partly responsible - with optional Loss or Damage Coverages)
Your car has an actual cash value of $12,000. You are involved in an accident
and are 25% responsible. Your car is a total loss.
Your Direct Compensation - Property Damage (DC-PD) deductible is $300.
Under DC-PD, we will pay $8,775 ($9,000 -- being 75% of the value of your
automobile -- less $225 -- being 75% of the deductible).
You have the optional Collision or Upset Coverage and your deductible is $500.
Under the optional coverage, we will pay a further $2,875 ($3,000 --being 25%
of the value of your auto --less $125 -- being 25% of the deductible).
In sum: You receive $11,650. You are responsible for the deductibles totalling
$350.

Example #4
(you are partly responsible - with optional Loss or Damage Coverages)
You are involved in an accident for which you are 25% responsible. Your car
sustains $5,000 in damage.
Your Direct Compensation - Property Damage (DC-PD) deductible is $300.
Under DC-PD, we will pay $3,525 ($3,750 -- being 75% of $5,000 --less $225
-- being 75% of the DC-PD deductible).
You have the optional Collision or Upset Coverage and your deductible is $500.
Under the optional coverage, we will pay a further $1,125 ($1,250 --being 25%
of $5,000 --less $125 -- being 25% of the deductible).
In sum: You receive $4,650. You are responsible for the deductibles totalling
$350.
If you are insured for loss or damage caused by fire or lightning, there is no deductible for these
losses.
7.4

Additional Benefits
Whatever Loss or Damage Coverage you choose under this Section, your coverage will include the
following additional benefits.
7.4.1

Payment of Charges
We will pay general average, salvage and fire department charges and any Canadian or U.S.
customs duties for which you are legally responsible as a result of an insured peril.
Example
Your car is damaged in a fire. The fire department properly bills you for the
cost of putting out the fire. A new transmission must be imported before the car
can be repaired. We will pay the fire department's bill, import duties on the
replacement part and for the parts and repairs themselves.
In this instance, salvage means any expense involved in recovering property to prevent loss
from an insured peril.
General average charges may arise when a described automobile is shipped by water. If it
becomes necessary to dump a portion of the ship's cargo overboard to save the ship, you may
be legally responsible for a share of the resulting losses. We will cover that expense.

(OAP 1) Owner’s Policy
Page 46

7.4.2

Foregoing Our Right to Recover
If someone else is using a described automobile with your permission when an insured loss
occurs, we will pay for the resulting claim. We will also forego our right to recover the money
from that person.
However, we will keep the right to recover payment:


if the person has the automobile in connection with the business of selling, repairing,
maintaining, storing, servicing or parking automobiles; or



if the person using the automobile violates any condition of this policy, or operates it in
circumstances referred to in 7.2.2.
Examples

7.4.3

1.

You allow a friend to use your car and she runs into a fire hydrant and
damages the car. We will pay for repairs and will not sue her to recover
the money.

2.

You hand over your car to a parking attendant or garage employee. He
scratches the side while parking it. We will pay for repairs and recover
from the garage owners because they had your automobile in connection
with their business.

3.

You allow a friend to use your car. Later, without your knowledge, he
drives it while impaired by alcohol and hits a tree. We will pay for the
repairs to the car, but we will recover from your friend. Driving while
impaired is illegal and a violation of the terms of this policy.

Temporary Substitute Automobile Covered
If you or anyone else drives a temporary substitute automobile (described in Section 2), you
may be responsible for any damage to it as a result of liability imposed by law or agreed to by
you or the driver. In that case, we will pay for direct damage for which you or the driver are
legally responsible, minus the deductible for that peril under this policy.
However, if the owner of the substitute automobile has it insured for such losses, and the
deductible on that policy is larger than the one on your own policy for such loss, the most we
will pay will be the difference between the two deductibles.
If there is a disagreement over who is responsible for the damage, we have the right just as we
would under Section 3 - Liability Coverage, to settle the matter appropriately and we will
cover the costs of any investigation, negotiation or lawsuit.

Example #1
You rent a car to replace your own, which is being repaired following an
accident. While driving the rental car, you cause $800 worth of damage to it.
The rental company has a collision policy with a $1,000 deductible. The
Collision deductible in your policy is only $500. In settling the matter, we will
pay $300 ($800 less $500).
Example #2
You rent a car to replace your own, which is being repaired following an
accident. While driving the rental car, you cause $2,800 worth of damage to it.
The rental company has a collision policy with a $1,000 deductible. The
Collision deductible in your policy is only $500. In settling the matter, we will
pay $500, the difference between the deductibles.
7.4.4

Loss of Use Due to Theft
If a described automobile is stolen, and you are protected by the All Perils, Comprehensive, or
Specified Perils options, we will pay reasonable expenses for the rental of a similar substitute
automobile.
If you choose not to rent an automobile, we will pay reasonable expenses incurred for taxis or
public transportation.
We won’t cover these costs until 72 hours after the theft has been reported to us or to the
police. Even if your policy expires after the theft, coverage will continue until your automobile
is repaired or replaced, or sooner if money is offered to settle the claim.
The most we will pay in either case for such expenses is $900.

7.5

Your and Other Insured Persons' Responsibilities
When making a claim under this Section, you and other insured persons must:


notify us in writing within seven days of the incident (or, if unable because of
incapacity, as soon as possible after that), giving us the best information available at
that time concerning the loss or damage and circumstances.



do as much as is reasonably possible to protect the automobile from further damage.
We will pay for any reasonable protection provided. Further damage resulting from
failure to provide reasonable protection will not be covered by this policy.

(OAP 1) Owner’s Policy
Page 48

7.6



make no repairs beyond those needed for protection of the automobile, or remove
evidence of the damage, without our written consent or until we have had time to
inspect the automobile.



allow us to copy all documents in your or other insured persons' possession that relate
to the incident.



permit us to inspect the automobile at any reasonable time.



complete a statutory declaration within 90 days of the incident, if requested. The
declaration will describe what happened in detail, the cause and amount of the loss,
those affected and how, and state that the loss was truly accidental. We will also need
to know if any other insurance is involved.



not leave us to dispose of the automobile unless we agree to accept it. If we decide to
replace the automobile or pay its actual cash value, less the deductible shown in your
Certificate of Automobile Insurance, we own the salvage.

Our Right to Repair, Replace or Rebuild the Automobile
We have the right to repair, replace or rebuild the automobile rather than pay for the damage. If we
choose to do this, we will let you or other insured persons know in writing within seven days of
receiving notice of the claim. We will complete the work within a reasonable time using parts of
similar kind and quality.

7.7

What We Will Pay
We will not pay more for the automobile than its actual cash value at the time it was damaged or
stolen, less the deductible shown in your Certificate of Automobile Insurance.
The value of the loss or damage is also based on actual cash value after taking into account
depreciation. We will not pay more to repair the automobile than its actual cash value at the time it
was damaged or stolen, less the deductible.
We will pay the lower of the following:



the cost to repair the loss or damage, less the deductible; or
the actual cash value of the automobile at the time it was damaged or stolen, less the
deductible.
Example
When your automobile was new, three years ago, it cost $16,000. Today, its
actual cash value is $10,000. You have the optional Comprehensive Coverage
and your deductible is $500. If the automobile were totally destroyed in a fire or

(OAP 1) Owner’s Policy

by lightning, the most we would pay under the optional coverage is $10,000. If
the automobile were stolen, the most we would pay under the optional coverage
is $9,500 ($10,000 - $500).
We will not pay more than $1,500 for loss or damage to electronic accessories or equipment other
than factory installed equipment. We will pay the actual cash value of the equipment up to $1,500 in
total.
“Electronic accessories and equipment” includes, but is not limited to, radios, tape players/decks,
stereo players/decks, compact disc players, speakers, telephones, two-way radios including CB radios,
ham radios and VHF radios, televisions, facsimile machines, electronic navigation assistance,
positioning and location finding devices, computers, and items of a similar nature.
“Factory installed equipment” means electronic accessories and equipment which was included in the
original new purchase price of the automobile.
7.8

Settling a Claim
If you disagree with us over the value of the vehicle or equipment or the nature or the amount or costs
of any repairs or the amount we should pay, the issue can be submitted for an appraisal under the
Insurance Act, if you ask for it, or if we ask for it and you agree. You and we will each appoint an
appraiser, who will either agree on the award or, if they disagree, will appoint an umpire to decide as
between their respective positions.

premium under the contract in instalments, the amount due under the contract as at the date
of the notice shall not exceed the amount of the instalments due but unpaid as at the date of
the notice.
(1.5) If the full amount payable under clause (b) of sub condition (1.3) is not paid by the time and

specified for termination.

termination mentioned in sub condition (1.2) and the full amount payable under clause (b) of
sub condition (1.3) has been paid by the time and in the manner that the notice specifies and
if a non-payment again occurs of the whole or any part of the premium due under the
contract or of any charge under any agreement ancillary to the contract, the insurer may, by
registered mail or personal delivery, give to the insured a notice of termination of the
contract and sub condition (1.1) applies to the notice, instead of sub condition (1.2).

(3) Where this contract is terminated by the insurer,
(a) the insurer shall refund the excess of premium actually paid by the insured over the
proportionate premium for the expired time, but in no event shall the proportionate
premium for the expired time be deemed to be less than any minimum retained premium
specified;
(b) if the termination is for a reason other than non-payment of the whole or any part of the
premium due under the contract or of any charge under any agreement ancillary to the
contract or if the insurer gives a notice of termination in accordance with sub condition
(1.7), the refund shall accompany the notice, unless the premium is subject to adjustment
or determination as to the amount, in which case, the refund shall be made as soon as
practicable; and
(c) if the termination is for the reason of non-payment of the whole or any part of the
premium due under the contract or of any charge under any agreement ancillary to the
contract and if sub condition (1.7) does not apply to the termination, the refund shall be
made as soon as practicable after the effective date of the termination.
