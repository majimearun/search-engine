PAYMENT OF LOSS
We may pay for loss in money or repair or replace
the damaged or stolen property. We may, at our
expense, return any stolen property to:
1. You; or
2. The address shown in this policy.
If we return stolen property we will pay for any damage resulting from the theft. We may keep all or part

If we pay for loss in money, our payment will include
the applicable sales tax for the damaged or stolen
property.
NO BENEFIT TO BAILEE
This insurance shall not directly or indirectly benefit
any carrier or other bailee for hire.
OTHER SOURCES OF RECOVERY
If other sources of recovery also cover the loss, we
will pay only our share of the loss. Our share is the
proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of
all applicable limits. However, any insurance we
provide with respect to a "non-owned auto" shall be
excess over any other collectible source of recovery
including, but not limited to:

"non-owned auto";
2. Any other applicable physical damage insurance;
3. Any other source of recovery applicable to the
loss.
APPRAISAL

either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In
this event, each party will select a competent appraiser. The two appraisers will select an umpire.
The appraisers will state separately the actual
cash value and the amount of loss. If they fail to
agree, they will submit their differences to the
umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will be
binding. Each party will:
1. Pay its chosen appraiser; and
2. Bear the expenses of the appraisal and umpire
equally.
B. We do not waive any of our rights under this policy by agreeing to an appraisal.

apply to your policy as of the date we implement
the change in your state. This Paragraph (C.)

obligation to pay; or
2. The amount of that obligation has been finally

it. Proof of mailing of any notice shall be sufficient proof of notice.

If this policy and any other auto insurance policy
issued to you by us apply to the same accident, the
maximum limit of our liability under all the policies
shall not exceed the highest applicable limit of liability
under any one policy.
