independent appraiser and notify the other of
the appraiser's identity within 20 calendar days

party.

the appraisers fail to agree within a reasonable

mortgagee the lesser of the principal and
interest due on the note on the date of loss

property for a fee regardless of any other
provision of this policy.

Recovered Property
If you or we recover any property for which we
have made payment under this policy, you or

Your Duty to Select and Maintain Policy Limits
At each policy renewal date, the amount of the
limit of liability stated in the declarations for
COVERAGE A may be adjusted to account for
inflation, current building costs, changes in the
cost of items of property and other factors. Any
adjustment of the amount of the COVERAGE A
limit of liability will result in proportionate
adjustments of the amounts of limits of liability

of liability of those OTHER COVERAGES –
