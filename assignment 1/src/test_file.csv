Policy A and another automobile with Liability Coverage for 300000 under a

applies each time you make a claim and separately to each automobile that is insured"

cost of putting out the fire A new transmission must be imported before the car
can be repaired We will pay the fire departments bill import duties on the
replacement part and for the parts and repairs themselves
In this instance salvage means any expense involved in recovering property to prevent loss
from an insured peril

If someone else is using a described automobile with your permission when an insured loss
occurs we will pay for the resulting claim We will also forego our right to recover the money
from that person

"if the person has the automobile in connection with the business of selling repairing
maintaining storing servicing or parking automobiles or"

the money"

may be responsible for any damage to it as a result of liability imposed by law or agreed to by
you or the driver In that case we will pay for direct damage for which you or the driver are
legally responsible minus the deductible for that peril under this policy
However if the owner of the substitute automobile has it insured for such losses and the
deductible on that policy is larger than the one on your own policy for such loss the most we
will pay will be the difference between the two deductibles
If there is a disagreement over who is responsible for the damage we have the right just as we
would under Section 3  Liability Coverage to settle the matter appropriately and we will
cover the costs of any investigation negotiation or lawsuit"
"Example 1
You rent a car to replace your own which is being repaired following an
accident While driving the rental car you cause 800 worth of damage to it

Collision deductible in your policy is only 500 In settling the matter we will
pay 300 800 less 500

You rent a car to replace your own which is being repaired following an
accident While driving the rental car you cause 2800 worth of damage to it
