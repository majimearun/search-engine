"Our Agreement
This policy is a legal contract under Massachusetts law Because
this is an auto policy it only covers accidents and losses which
result from the ownership maintenance or use of autos The exact
protection is determined by the coverages you purchased
We agree to provide the insurance protection you purchased for
accidents which happen while this policy is in force
You agree to pay premiums when due and to cooperate with us in
case of accidents or claims
Our contract consists of this policy the Coverage Selections Page
any endorsements agreed upon and your application for insurance
Oral promises or statements made by you or our agent are not part
of this policy
There are many laws of Massachusetts relating to automobile
insurance We and you must and do agree that when those laws
apply they are part of this policy"
"Compulsory
Insurance
There are four Parts to Compulsory Insurance They are called
Compulsory Insurance because Massachusetts law requires you to
buy all of them before you can register your auto No law requires
you to buy more than this Compulsory Insurance However if you
have financed your auto the bank or finance company may legally
insist that you have some Optional Insurance as a condition of your
loan
The amount of your coverage and the cost of each Part is shown on
the Coverage Selections Page
Your Compulsory Insurance does not pay for any damage to your
auto no matter what happens to it"
"Under this Part we will pay damages to people injured or killed by
your auto in Massachusetts accidents The damages we will pay
are the amounts the injured person is entitled to collect for bodily
injury through a court judgment or settlement We will pay only if you
or someone else using your auto with your consent is legally
responsible for the accident The most we will pay for injuries to one
or more persons as a result of bodily injury to any one person in any
one accident is 20000 Subject to this 20000 limit the most we
will pay for injuries to two or more people as the result of bodily injury
to two or more people in any one accident is 40000 This is the
most we will pay as the result of a single accident no matter how many
autos or premiums are shown on the Coverage Selections Page
We will not pay
1 For injuries to guest occupants of your auto
2 For accidents outside of Massachusetts or in places in Massachusetts where the public has no right of access
3 For injuries to any employees of the legally responsible person if
they are entitled to Massachusetts workers’ compensation benefits
The law provides a special protection for anyone entitled to damages
under this Part We must pay their claims even if false statements
were made when applying for this policy or your auto registration We
must also pay even if you or the legally responsible person fails to
cooperate with us after the accident We will however be entitled to
reimbursement from the person who did not cooperate or who made
any false statements
If a claim is covered by us and also by another company authorized to
sell auto insurance in Massachusetts we will pay only our
proportionate share If someone covered under this Part is using an
auto he or she does not own at the time of the accident the owner’s"
"auto insurance must pay its limits before we pay Then we will pay up
to the limits shown on your Coverage Selections Page for any damages
not covered by that insurance
Part 2
Personal Injury
Protection"
"The benefits under this Part are commonly known as “PIP” or “NoFault” benefits It makes no difference who is legally responsible for
the accident
We will pay the benefits described below to you and other people injured
or killed in auto accidents For any one accident we will pay as many
people as are injured but the most we will pay for injuries to any one
person is 8000 This is the most we will pay no matter how many
autos or premiums are shown on the Coverage Selections Page
We will pay three kinds of benefits
A Medical Expenses
We will pay all reasonable expenses incurred as a result of the accident
for necessary medical surgical Xray and dental services This includes
prosthetic devices It also includes ambulance hospital professional
nursing and funeral services
B Lost Wages
If an injured person is out of work because of the accident we will pay
lost wages up to 75 of his or her average weekly gross wage or
equivalent for the year ending on the day immediately before the
accident We will not pay for the loss of any other type of income If the
injured person was unemployed at the time of the accident we will pay
up to 75 of the amount he or she actually lost in earning power as a
result of the accident
C Replacement Services
We will reimburse the injured person for reasonable payments made to
anyone outside his or her household for necessary services that he or
she would have performed without pay for the benefit of the household
had he or she not been injured
We will pay PIP benefits to or for
1 You or any other person if injured while occupying your auto with
your consent
2 You or anyone living in your household if injured while occupying
an auto which does not have Massachusetts Compulsory Insurance or if
struck by an auto which does not have Massachusetts Compulsory
Insurance
3 Any pedestrian including you if struck by your auto in"
"Massachusetts or any Massachusetts resident who while a
pedestrian is struck by your auto outside of Massachusetts
Benefits are paid only for expenses or losses actually incurred within
two years after the accident
If the accident is in Massachusetts or if it is outside Massachusetts
and the injured person does not sue for damages we will pay benefits
within a reasonable time – usually thirty days If the accident is
outside Massachusetts and the injured person does sue then we can
wait for a settlement or judgment before paying benefits
Some people have a wage continuation program at work If so we
will pay them only the difference between the total we would ordinarily pay under this Part and the amount of the program payments
We will however reimburse the program if it allows benefits to be
converted into cash or additional retirement credit Sometimes
program benefits are reduced or used up because of payments to the
person injured in an accident In that case we will pay for lost wages
resulting from any other illness or injury that person has within one
year of our last payment The exact amount of our payments under
this paragraph will be determined by Massachusetts law
Some people have a policy of health sickness or disability insurance or a contract or agreement with a group organization partnership or corporation to provide pay for or reimburse the cost of
medical expenses “health plan” If so we will pay up to 2000 of
medical expenses for any injured person We will also pay medical
expenses in excess of 2000 for such injured person which will not be
paid by a health plan Medical expenses must be submitted to the
health plan to determine what the health plan will pay before we pay
benefits in excess of 2000 under this Part We will not pay for
medical expenses in excess of 2000 that the health plan would have
paid had the injured person sought treatment in accordance with the
requirements of the health plan In any case our total payment for
medical expenses lost wages and replacement services will not
exceed 8000
Within two years after an accident we may at our option pay the cost
of renewing or continuing in force a policy of health sickness or
disability insurance for anyone covered under this Part who is
unwilling or unable to pay such cost Our payment will not exceed the
cost of renewing or continuing such policy for a period of two years
after the accident Also our payment will not operate to reduce the
benefits otherwise payable under this Part"
"We will not pay PIP benefits to or for
1 Anyone who at the time of the accident was operating or
occupying a motorcycle any motor vehicle not subject to motor
vehicle registration or a motorized bicycle including a moped
2 Anyone who contributed to his or her injury by operating an auto
a while under the influence of alcohol marijuana or a narcotic drug
b while committing a felony or seeking to avoid arrest by a police
officer or c with the specific intent of causing injury to himself
herself or others
3 Anyone who is entitled to benefits under any workers’
compensation law for the same injury
When you purchased this Part you were given the choice of either
excluding yourself or yourself and household members from some
or all of the PIP coverage The portion of each claim you may have
agreed not to be covered for is called a “deductible” You paid a
smaller premium if you chose a deductible In that case we will only
pay up to the difference between 8000 and the amount of your
deductible The deductible is shown on the Coverage Selections
Page
If anyone is entitled to PIP benefits and also to benefits under another
Part of this policy we will pay from this Part first
We will not pay PIP benefits to or for an injured person to the
extent those benefits would duplicate expenses or losses recovered
by that person in a court judgment or settlement
If anyone covered under this policy is also entitled to PIP benefits from
any other auto policy the total benefits payable will not be more than
the highest amount payable under whichever one of the policies would
have paid the most In that case each insurer will pay only its
proportionate share We will not pay benefits under this Part which
duplicate payments made under the NoFault coverage of any other
auto policy
Part 3

Caused By An
Uninsured Auto"

for an accident is uninsured Some accidents involve unidentified
hitandrun autos Under this Part we will pay damages for bodily

uninsured or hitandrun autos We will pay only if the injured person
is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of the
uninsured or hitandrun auto We will pay for hitandrun accidents
only if the owner or operator causing the accident cannot be identified"
"Sometimes the company insuring the auto responsible
for an accident will deny coverage or become insolvent We consider
such an auto to be uninsured for purposes of this Part However we do

Optional Insurance because they are not required by law The
amount of insurance and cost of any of these Parts you purchased is
shown on the Coverage Selections Page
With the exception of Towing and Labor Part 11 we must sell you
any or all of the Optional coverages you wish subject to certain
deductibles and limits specified in Massachusetts law However
Massachusetts law provides that we may refuse to sell Collision Part
7 and Comprehensive Part 9 or both in certain specified instances
Because two of the Optional coverages – Collision Part 7 and
Limited Collision Part 8 – duplicate each other in many ways you
may buy one of them but not both If you do not buy either one you
still have the right to sue people who damage your auto but we will
not provide any assistance to you under this policy

accidents if you or a household member is legally responsible for
the accident We will also pay damages if someone else using your
auto with your consent is legally responsible for the accident The
damages we will pay are the amounts the injured person is entitled to
collect for bodily injury through a court judgment or settlement
This Part is similar to Compulsory Bodily Injury To Others Part 1
Like the Compulsory Part this Part pays for accidents involving your
auto in Massachusetts Also like the Compulsory Part this Part does

"If the accident occurs in any other state or in a Canadian province and
you have purchased any coverage at all under this Part your policy
will automatically apply to that accident as follows
If the state or province has

liability for bodily injury or property damage higher than the limits you
have purchased your policy will provide the higher specified limits
2 A compulsory insurance or similar law requiring your auto to have
insurance whenever it is used in the state or province your policy will
provide at least the required minimum amounts and types of
coverage

not own at the time of the accident the owner’s auto insurance must
pay its limits before we pay Then we will pay for any damages not
paid by that insurance up to the policy limits shown on your Coverage
Selections Page However if the claim is covered by us and another
auto policy we will pay only our proportionate share of those damages
not paid by the owner’s auto insurance

Caused By An Uninsured Auto Part 3 will reduce the amount of
damages that person is entitled to recover from anyone covered under
this Part

result of an accident covered under this Part including bail bonds for
traffic law violations related to the accident"

costs of recovery including reasonable attorney’s fees Any amount
recovered because of a payment we make under Part 3 or Part 12
of this policy shall first be applied to any unpaid damages due that
person Such unpaid damages must be a part of a claim settled

person legally responsible for an accident and also receive money
from us for the same accident If so the amount we paid must be

or someone else recover money from the person legally responsible for the accident and also receive money from us for the same
accident as a payment under Part 3 or Part 12 of this policy we
must be repaid for any amounts so paid but only to the extent that
such recovery exceeds any unpaid damages due that person under

owed us can be reduced by our proportionate share of the costs of
