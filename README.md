# IR Search Engine

My first search engine built using Python, Numpy, Pandas and spaCy

## Functionality

1. Free queries ('and' and 'or' searches)

2. Phrase queries (uses biwords)

3. Wildcard querying for both of the above types (allowed types: 'abc\*', '\*xyz', 'abc\*xyz')

4. Ranking based on tf-idf scores

5. Spelling correction

6. Autocomplete results
