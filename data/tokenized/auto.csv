Introduction 1  This insurance policy is a legal contract between the policy-owner 
(you) and the company (we or us).  It insures you and your auto for 
the period shown on the Coverage Selections Page. 
As long as you pay your premium, we agree to provide you or others 
the benefits to which you or they are entitled.  The exact terms and 
conditions are explained in the following pages. 
There are two basic categories of insurance described in this policy, 
Compulsory Insurance and Optional Insurance.  Compulsory 
There are four Parts to Compulsory Insurance.  They are all re- 
Insurance 
quired by law.  Every auto registered in Massachusetts must have 
them.  Optional 
There are eight Parts to Optional Insurance.  Some of them extend 
Insurance 
the coverage or the amounts of protection provided by Compulsory 
Insurance.  Some of them provide protection not found in Compulsory 
Insurance.  You do not have to buy any of these eight Parts if you do 
not want to.  Auto insurance claims arise in hundreds of different ways.  Autos are 
sometimes stolen or damaged.  Accidents may injure people in your 
auto, people in other autos or pedestrians.  You may be responsible 
for an accident or someone else may be.  An accident may happen in 
Massachusetts or out of state.  Different situations require different 
kinds of insurance. 
Please read the whole policy to see what kinds of insurance are 
available to cover these different situations.  At the same time, you 
should check the Coverage Selections Page to make sure it correctly 
indicates the coverages you purchased.  Each coverage you 
purchased will show a premium charge next to it.  If no premium 
charge is shown, you do not have that coverage. 
Sometimes you and we will agree to change this policy.  The only way 
that can be done is by an “Endorsement” added to the basic policy 
form.  All endorsements must be in writing.  They then become part of 
this policy. 
We are pleased to have you as a customer and hope you have a safe 
and accident-free year. But if you need us, we are here to help you.  If 
you have an accident or loss, or if someone sues you, contact your 
agent or us. 
Do the same if you have any questions or complaints.  If you think we 
have treated you unfairly at any time, you may contact the Division of 
Insurance, (617) 521-7777",introduction insurance policy legal contract policy owner company insure auto period show coverage selections page long pay premium agree provide benefit entitle exact term condition explain follow page basic category insurance describe policy compulsory insurance optional insurance compulsory part compulsory insurance insurance quire law auto register massachusetts optional part optional insurance extend insurance coverage amount protection provide compulsory insurance provide protection find compulsory insurance buy part want auto insurance claim arise hundred different way auto steal damage accidents injure people auto people auto pedestrian responsible accident accident happen massachusetts state different situation require different kind insurance read policy kind insurance available cover different situation time check coverage selections page sure correctly indicate coverage purchase coverage purchase premium charge premium charge show coverage agree change policy way endorsement add basic policy form endorsement writing policy pleased customer hope safe accident free year need help accident loss sue contact agent question complaint think treat unfairly time contact division insurance

Compulsory 
Insurance 
There are four Parts to Compulsory Insurance.  They are called 
Compulsory Insurance because Massachusetts law requires you to 
buy all of them before you can register your auto.  No law requires 
you to buy more than this Compulsory Insurance.  However, if you 
have financed your auto, the bank or finance company may legally 
insist that you have some Optional Insurance as a condition of your 
loan. 
The amount of your coverage and the cost of each Part is shown on 
the Coverage Selections Page. 
Your Compulsory Insurance does not pay for any damage to your 
auto no matter what happens to it. 
Part 1. 
Under this Part, we will pay damages to people injured or killed by 
Bodily Injury 
your auto in Massachusetts accidents.  The damages we will pay 
To Others 
are the amounts the injured person is entitled to collect for bodily 
injury through a court judgment or settlement.  We will pay only if you 
or someone else using your auto with your consent is legally 
responsible for the accident.  The most we will pay for injuries to one 
or more persons as a result of bodily injury to any one person in any 
one accident is $20,000.  Subject to this $20,000 limit, the most we 
will pay for injuries to two or more people as the result of bodily injury 
to two or more people in any one accident is $40,000.  This is the 
most we will pay as the result of a single accident no matter how many 
autos or premiums are shown on the Coverage Selections Page. 
We will not pay: 
1. For injuries to guest occupants of your auto. 
2. For accidents outside of Massachusetts or in places in Massa- 
chusetts where the public has no right of access. 
3. For injuries to any employees of the legally responsible person if 
they are entitled to Massachusetts workers’ compensation benefits. 
The law provides a special protection for anyone entitled to damages 
under this Part.  We must pay their claims even if false statements 
were made when applying for this policy or your auto registration. We 
must also pay even if you or the legally responsible person fails to 
cooperate with us after the accident.  We will, however, be entitled to 
reimbursement from the person who did not cooperate or who made 
any false statements. 
If a claim is covered by us and also by another company authorized to 
sell auto insurance in Massachusetts, we will pay only our 
proportionate share.  If someone covered under this Part is using an 
auto he or she does not own at the time of the accident, the owner’s

Compulsory  Insurance  (Continued) 
5 auto insurance must pay its limits before we pay.  Then, we will pay, up 
to the limits shown on your Coverage Selections Page, for any damages 
not covered by that insurance. 
Part 2. 
The benefits under this Part are commonly known as “PIP” or “No-  
Personal Injury 
Fault” benefits. It makes no difference who is legally responsible for 
Protection 
the accident. 
We will pay the benefits described below to you and other people injured 
or killed in auto accidents. For any one accident, we will pay as many 
people as are injured, but the most we will pay for injuries to any one 
person is $8,000.  This is the most we will pay no matter how many 
autos or premiums are shown on the Coverage Selections Page. 
We will pay three kinds of benefits: 
A. Medical Expenses 
We will pay all reasonable expenses incurred as a result of the accident 
for necessary medical, surgical, X-ray and dental services.  This includes 
prosthetic devices. It also includes ambulance, hospital, professional 
nursing and funeral services. 
B. Lost Wages 
If an injured person is out of work because of the accident, we will pay 
lost wages up to 75% of his or her average weekly gross wage or 
equivalent for the year ending on the day immediately before the 
accident.  We will not pay for the loss of any other type of income. If the 
injured person was unemployed at the time of the accident, we will pay 
up to 75% of the amount he or she actually lost in earning power as a 
result of the accident. 
C. Replacement Services 
We will reimburse the injured person for reasonable payments made to 
anyone outside his or her household for necessary services that he or 
she would have performed without pay for the benefit of the household, 
had he or she not been injured. 
We will pay PIP benefits to or for: 
1. You, or any other person, if injured while occupying your auto with 
your consent. 
2. You, or anyone living in your household, if injured while occupying 
an auto which does not have Massachusetts Compulsory Insurance or if 
struck by an auto which does not have Massachusetts Compulsory 
Insurance

(Continued) 
Massachusetts or any Massachusetts resident who, while a 
pedestrian, is struck by your auto outside of Massachusetts. 
Benefits are paid only for expenses or losses actually incurred within 
two years after the accident. 
If the accident is in Massachusetts, or if it is outside Massachusetts 
and the injured person does not sue for damages, we will pay benefits 
within a reasonable time – usually thirty days.  If the accident is 
outside Massachusetts and the injured person does sue, then we can 
wait for a settlement or judgment before paying benefits. 
Some people have a wage continuation program at work.  If so, we 
will pay them only the difference between the total we would ordi-
narily pay under this Part and the amount of the program payments.  
We will, however, reimburse the program if it allows benefits to be 
converted into cash or additional retirement credit.  Sometimes 
program benefits are reduced or used up because of payments to the 
person injured in an accident.  In that case, we will pay for lost wages 
resulting from any other illness or injury that person has within one 
year of our last payment.  The exact amount of our payments under 
this paragraph will be determined by Massachusetts law. 
Some people have a policy of health, sickness, or disability insur- 
ance or a contract or agreement with a group, organization part- 
nership or corporation to provide, pay for, or reimburse the cost of 
medical expenses (“health plan”).  If so, we will pay up to $2,000 of 
medical expenses for any injured person.  We will also pay medical 
expenses in excess of $2,000 for such injured person which will not be 
paid by a health plan.  Medical expenses must be submitted to the 
health plan to determine what the health plan will pay before we pay 
benefits in excess of $2,000 under this Part.  We will not pay for 
medical expenses in excess of $2,000 that the health plan would have 
paid had the injured person sought treatment in accordance with the 
requirements of the health plan.  In any case, our total payment for 
medical expenses, lost wages and replacement services will not 
exceed $8,000. 
Within two years after an accident, we may, at our option, pay the cost 
of renewing or continuing in force a policy of health, sickness or 
disability insurance for anyone covered under this Part who is 
unwilling or unable to pay such cost.  Our payment will not exceed the 
cost of renewing or continuing such policy for a period of two years 
after the accident.  Also, our payment will not operate to reduce the 
benefits otherwise payable under this Part.

We will not pay PIP benefits to or for: 
1. Anyone who, at the time of the accident, was operating or 
occupying a motorcycle, any motor vehicle not subject to motor 
vehicle registration, or a motorized bicycle, including a moped. 
2. Anyone who contributed to his or her injury by operating an auto 
(a) while under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, or a narcotic drug, 
(b) while committing a felony or seeking to avoid arrest by a police 
officer, or (c) with the specific intent of causing injury to himself, 
herself or others. 
3. Anyone who is entitled to benefits under any workers’ 
compensation law for the same injury. 
When you purchased this Part you were given the choice of either 
excluding yourself, or yourself and household members, from some 
or all of the PIP coverage.  The portion of each claim you may have 
agreed not to be covered for is called a “deductible.” You paid a 
smaller premium if you chose a deductible.  In that case, we will only 
pay up to the difference between $8,000 and the amount of your 
deductible.  The deductible is shown on the Coverage Selections 
Page. 
If anyone is entitled to PIP benefits and also to benefits under another 
Part of this policy, we will pay from this Part first. 
We will not pay PIP benefits to or for an injured person, to the  
extent those benefits would duplicate expenses or losses recovered 
by that person in a court judgment or settlement. 
If anyone covered under this policy is also entitled to PIP benefits from 
any other auto policy, the total benefits payable will not be more than 
the highest amount payable under whichever one of the policies would 
have paid the most.  In that case, each insurer will pay only its 
proportionate share.  We will not pay benefits under this Part which 
duplicate payments made under the No-Fault coverage of any other 
auto policy. 
Part 3. 
Sometimes an owner or operator of an auto legally responsible 
Bodily Injury 
for an accident is uninsured.  Some accidents involve unidentified 
Caused By An 
hit-and-run autos.  Under this Part, we will pay damages for bodily 
Uninsured Auto 
injury to people injured or killed in certain accidents caused by 
uninsured or hit-and-run autos.  We will pay only if the injured person 
is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of the 
uninsured or hit-and-run auto.  We will pay for hit-and-run accidents 
only if the owner or operator causing the accident cannot be identified",compulsory insurance continued pay pip benefit time accident operate occupy motorcycle motor vehicle subject motor vehicle registration motorized bicycle include moped contribute injury operate auto influence alcohol marijuana narcotic drug b commit felony seek avoid arrest police officer c specific intent cause injury entitle benefit worker compensation law injury purchase give choice exclude household member pip coverage portion claim agree cover call deductible pay small premium choose deductible case pay difference deductible deductible show coverage selections page entitle pip benefit benefit policy pay pay pip benefit injured person extent benefit duplicate expense loss recover person court judgment settlement cover policy entitle pip benefit auto policy total benefit payable high payable whichever policy pay case insurer pay proportionate share pay benefit duplicate payment fault coverage auto policy owner operator auto legally responsible bodily injury accident uninsured accident involve unidentified cause hit run auto pay damage bodily uninsured auto injury people injure kill certain accident cause uninsured hit run auto pay injure person legally entitle recover owner operator uninsured hit run auto pay hit run accident owner operator cause accident identify

(Continued) 
Sometimes the company insuring the auto responsible  
for an accident will deny coverage or become insolvent.  We consider 
such an auto to be uninsured for purposes of this Part.  However, we do 
not consider an auto owned by a governmental unit or someone who is 
legally self-insured to be an uninsured auto. 
This Part is Compulsory.  You must have limits of $20,000 per person 
and $40,000 per accident.  However, you may want to buy more 
protection.  If so, we must sell you limits up to $35,000 per person and 
$80,000 per accident, provided you have purchased at least these limits 
for Part 5.  Higher limits may be purchased if agreed upon by you and 
by us. 
We will pay damages to or for: 
1. You, while occupying your auto, while occupying an auto you do 
not own, or if injured as a pedestrian. 
2. Any household member, while occupying your auto, while 
occupying an auto not owned by you or if injured as a pedestrian.  If 
there are two or more policies which provide coverage at the   same limits, we will only pay our proportionate share.  We will not pay 
damages to or for any household member who has a Massachusetts 
auto policy of his or her own or who is covered by any Massachusetts 
auto policy of another household member providing uninsured auto 
insurance with higher limits. 
3. Anyone else while occupying your auto.  We will not pay damages 
to or for anyone else who has a Massachusetts auto  
policy of his or her own, or who is covered by any Massachusetts auto 
policy of another household member providing uninsured  
auto insurance. 
4. Anyone else for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of 
injury to a person covered under this Part. 
If you are injured while occupying your auto and you have two or 
more autos insured with us with different limits, we will only pay up to 
the limits shown on your Coverage Selections Page for the auto you are 
occupying when injured. 
If you are injured as a pedestrian or while occupying an auto you do 
not own and you have two or more Massachusetts auto policies which 
provide coverage at different limits, the policy with the higher limits will 
pay.  If there are two or more policies which provide coverage at the 
same limits, we will only pay our proportionate share.  We will not pay damages to or for you, if struck by, or while occupying

an auto you own and which does not have Massachusetts compulsory 
auto insurance. 
Likewise, we will not pay damages to or for any household member if 
struck by, or while occupying an auto owned by that household 
member which does not have Massachusetts compulsory auto 
insurance. 
The most we will pay for damages to or for anyone injured in the 
following situations is $35,000 per person and $80,000 per accident or 
the limits you purchased, whichever is less: 
1. Anyone injured while occupying your auto while it is being used 
as a public or livery conveyance.  This does not apply to the use of 
your auto in a share-the-expense car pool arrangement or in an 
expense reimbursement program either as a volunteer or at work. 
2. Anyone injured while using an auto without the consent of the 
owner. 
3. Anyone injured while an auto is being operated in any 
prearranged or organized racing, speed, stunting or demolition contest 
or activity or in practice or preparation for any such contest or activity.  We will reduce the damages an injured person is entitled to recover 
by: 
1. The amount recovered from any legally responsible person 
provided the injured person is fully compensated for his or her 
damages for bodily injury. 
2. The amount paid under a workers’ compensation law or similar 
law. 
3. Any expenses that are payable or would have been payable, 
except for a deductible, under the PIP coverage of this policy or any 
other Massachusetts auto policy. 
We will pay the balance of the damages up to the limits shown for this 
Part on your Coverage Selections Page. 
The determination as to whether an injured person is legally entitled to 
recover damages from the legally responsible owner or operator will 
be by agreement between us and the injured person.  The amount of 
the damages, if any, will be determined in the same way.  Arbitration 
will be used if no agreement can be reached.  However, in no event 
may a demand for arbitration constitute first notice of claim.  We must 
be given sufficient notice of claim to conduct a reasonable 
investigation and attempt settlement before arbitration can be filed",compulsory insurance continued auto massachusetts compulsory auto insurance likewise pay damage household member strike occupy auto own household member massachusetts compulsory auto insurance pay damage injure follow situation person accident limit purchase whichever injure occupy auto public livery conveyance apply use auto share expense car pool arrangement expense reimbursement program volunteer work injure auto consent owner injure auto operate prearranged organized racing speed stunting demolition contest activity practice preparation contest activity reduce damage injure person entitle recover recover legally responsible person provide injure person fully compensate damage bodily injury pay worker compensation law similar law expense payable payable deductible pip coverage policy massachusetts auto policy pay balance damage limit show coverage selections page determination injure person legally entitle recover damage legally responsible owner operator agreement injure person damage determine way arbitration agreement reach event demand arbitration constitute notice claim give sufficient notice claim conduct reasonable investigation attempt settlement arbitration file

If an injured person settles a claim as a result of an accident covered under this 
Part, we will pay that person only if the claim was settled with our consent.  We 
will not be bound under this Part by any judgment resulting from a lawsuit 
brought without our written consent.  We will not, however, unreasonably 
withhold our consent. 
The most we will pay for injuries to one or more persons as a result of bodily 
injury to any one person in any one accident is shown on the Coverage 
Selections Page as the “per person” limit.  Subject to this limit, the most we will 
pay for injuries to two or more people as the result of bodily injury to two or more 
people in any one accident is shown on the Coverage Selections Page as the 
“per accident” limit.  This is the most we will pay as the result of a single accident. 
The limits of two or more autos or policies shall not be added to- gether, 
combined, or stacked, to determine the limits of coverage available to anyone 
covered under this Part, regardless of the number of autos involved, persons 
covered, claims made, or premiums shown on the Coverage Selections Page. 
We will not make payments under this Part which duplicate payments under the 
uninsured auto insurance of any other auto policy. 
The Part will not benefit any insurer or self-insurer under a workers’ 
compensation law or any similar law. 
Part 4. 
Under this Part, we will pay damages to someone else whose auto 
Damage to 
or other property is damaged in an accident.  The damages we will 
Someone Else’s 
pay are the amounts that person is legally entitled to collect for

property damage through a court judgment or settlement.  We will pay only if you, 
or a household member, is legally responsible for the accident. We will also pay 
if someone else using your auto with your consent is legally responsible for the 
accident.  Damages include any applicable sales tax and the costs resulting from 
the loss of use of the damaged property.

not apply to the use of your auto in a share-the-expense car pool arrangement 
or in an expense reimbursement program either as a volunteer or at work. 
2. While any auto is being used by anyone in the course of his or her 
employment in the business of selling, servicing, repairing or parking autos.  This 
exclusion does not apply to the ownership, maintenance or use of your auto by

business of selling, servicing, repairing or parking autos.  This exclusion does not

10,000 pounds and not used for the delivery or transportation of goods or

7.   When the property damage is caused by anyone using an auto without the 
consent of the owner.

the Coverage Selections Page.  This is the most we will pay as the result of a 
single accident no matter how many autos or premiums are shown on the 
Coverage Selections Page. 
If someone covered under this Part is using an auto he or she does not own at 
the time of the accident, the owner’s auto insurance must pay its limit before 
we pay.   Then, we will pay for any damages not paid by that insurance, up to 
the policy limit shown on the Coverage Selections Page.  However, if the claim 
is covered by us and another auto policy, we will pay only our proportionate 
share of those damages not paid by the owner’s auto insurance. 
Under this Part, we may have to pay for property damage even if you or the 
legally responsible person fails to give us prompt notice of the accident.  In 
that case we may be entitled to reimbursement from that person. 
This Part is Compulsory.  You must have limits of at least $5,000.  However, 
you may want to buy more protection.  Higher limits may be purchased if 
agreed upon by you and by us.  However, $5,000 is the most we will pay for

Optional 
Insurance 
There are eight separate Parts to Optional Insurance.  They are called 
Optional Insurance because they are not required by law.  The 
amount of insurance and cost of any of these Parts you purchased is 
shown on the Coverage Selections Page. 
With the exception of Towing and Labor (Part 11), we must sell you 
any or all of the Optional coverages you wish, subject to certain 
deductibles and limits specified in Massachusetts law.  However, 
Massachusetts law provides that we may refuse to sell Collision (Part 
7) and Comprehensive (Part 9), or both, in certain specified instances. 
Because two of the Optional coverages – Collision (Part 7) and 
Limited Collision (Part 8) – duplicate each other in many ways, you 
may buy one of them but not both. If you do not buy either one, you 
still have the right to sue people who damage your auto but we will 
not provide any assistance to you under this policy. 
We will not pay under any of the Optional coverages: 
1. If the accident happens while your auto is being used as a public 
or livery conveyance.  This does not apply to the use of your auto in a 
share-the-expense car pool arrangement or in an expense 
reimbursement program either as a volunteer or at work. 
2. For loss of any items used in the reproduction of sound, unless 
they have been permanently installed in the auto.  However, we will 
pay for the loss of any such item if it operates in the auto exclusively 
and only when used in combination with the components permanently 
installed in the auto. Tapes, discs, and records are not covered. 
3. For loss of or damage to a citizens band radio, two-way mobile 
radio, telephone or scanning monitor receiver, including their related 
equipment.  We will pay, however, for such loss or damage if this 
equipment is permanently installed in the opening of the dash or 
console normally used by the auto manufacturer for the installation of 
a radio or a telephone. 
4. For loss of or damage to any custom furnishings or custom 
equipment in or upon any pick-up truck, van or similar vehicle.  
Custom furnishings or custom equipment include but are not limited to 
the following items: special carpeting and insulation, furniture, bars, 
television receivers, facilities for cooking and sleeping, height-
extending roofs, custom murals, paintings or other decals or graphics. 
5. For loss or damage to equipment designed for the detection or 
avoidance of any law enforcement speed measuring device.  This 
does not apply to electronic equipment designed solely for safety 
warning systems.

6. For injury or damage that is intentionally caused by you, a 
household member or anyone else using your auto with your 
consent. 
Part 5. 
Under this Part, we will pay damages to people injured or killed in 
Optional Bodily 
accidents if you or a household member is legally responsible for 
Injury to Others 
the accident. We will also pay damages if someone else using your  auto with your consent is legally responsible for the accident.  The 
damages we will pay are the amounts the injured person is entitled to 
collect for bodily injury through a court judgment or settlement. 
This Part is similar to Compulsory Bodily Injury To Others (Part 1). 
Like the Compulsory Part, this Part pays for accidents involving your 
auto in Massachusetts.  Also like the Compulsory Part, this Part does 
not pay for the benefit of anyone using an auto without the consent of 
the owner. 
Unlike the Compulsory Part, this Part does provide coverage for 
injuries to guest occupants and for accidents occurring outside 
Massachusetts. 
In addition, we will not pay: 
1. For injuries to employees of the person using the auto who are 
injured in the course of employment. 
2. For injuries resulting from an accident while a household 
member, other than your spouse, is using an auto which you or any 
household member owns or uses regularly, unless a premium for 
this Part is shown for that auto on the Coverage Selections Page. 
3. For injuries resulting from an accident while you or your spouse, if 
a household member, are using an auto which you or your spouse, if 
a household member, own or use regularly unless a premium for this 
Part is shown for that auto on the Coverage Selections Page. 
4. While any auto is being used by anyone in the course of his or her 
employment in the business of selling, servicing, repairing, or parking 
autos.  This exclusion does not apply to the ownership, maintenance 
or use of your auto by you or a household member. 
5. While anyone is using a vehicle in the course of any business 
other than the business of selling, servicing, repairing or parking 
autos.  This exclusion does not apply to private passenger autos, or to 
pick-up trucks, vans, or similar vehicles having a gross vehicle weight 
of less than 10,000 pounds and not used for the delivery or 
transportation of goods or materials unless such use is incidental to 
your business of installing, maintaining, or repairing furnishings or

14  Optional 
Insurance 
(Continued) 
If the accident occurs in any other state or in a Canadian province and 
you have purchased any coverage at all under this Part, your policy 
will automatically apply to that accident as follows: 
If the state or province has: 
1. A financial responsibility law or similar law specifying limits of 
liability for bodily injury or property damage higher than the limits you 
have purchased, your policy will provide the higher specified limits. 
2. A compulsory insurance or similar law requiring your auto to have 
insurance whenever it is used in the state or province, your policy will 
provide at least the required minimum amounts and types of 
coverage. 
The limits shown for this Part on the Coverage Selections Page are 
the total limits you have under Compulsory Bodily Injury to Others 
(Part 1) and this Part.  This means that the Compulsory limits are 
included within the limits shown on the Coverage Selections Page for 
this Part and are not in addition to them. 
The most we will pay for injuries to one or more persons as a result of 
bodily injury to any one person in any one accident is shown on the 
Coverage Selections Page as the “per person” limit for the auto 
involved in that accident.  Subject to this limit, the most we will pay for 
injuries to two or more people as the result of bodily injury to two or 
more people in any one accident is shown on the Coverage Selections 
Page as the “per accident” limit for the auto involved in that accident.  
This is the most we will pay as the result of a single accident no matter 
how many autos or premiums are shown on the Coverage Selections 
Page. 
If someone covered under this Part is using an auto he or she does 
not own at the time of the accident, the owner’s auto insurance must 
pay its limits before we pay.  Then, we will pay for any damages not 
paid by that insurance, up to the policy limits shown on your Coverage 
Selections Page.  However, if the claim is covered by us and another 
auto policy, we will pay only our proportionate share of those damages 
not paid by the owner’s auto insurance. 
Any payments we make to anyone or for anyone under Bodily Injury 
Caused By An Uninsured Auto (Part 3) will reduce the amount of 
damages that person is entitled to recover from anyone covered under 
this Part. 
We will also pay up to $250 for the cost of bail bonds required as a 
result of an accident covered under this Part including bail bonds for 
traffic law violations related to the accident.

We must sell you limits up to $35,000 per person and $80,000 per 
accident if you want to buy them. Higher limits may be purchased if 
agreed upon by you and by us. However, while an auto covered under 
this Part is being operated in any prearranged or organized racing, 
speed, stunting or demolition contest or activity or in practice or 
preparation for any such contest or activity, the most we will pay is the 
required minimum limits. 
Part 6. 
Under this Part, we will pay reasonable expenses for necessary 
Medical Payments medical and funeral services incurred as a result of an accident. 
We will pay for expenses resulting from bodily injuries to anyone 
occupying your auto at the time of the accident.  We will also pay for 
expenses resulting from bodily injuries to you or any household 
member if struck by an auto or if occupying someone else’s auto at 
the time of the accident. 
We will not pay for expenses resulting from injuries to: 
1. Anyone injured while in a vehicle which had been placed off the 
public roads for use as a residence. 
2. Anyone injured in the course of employment in selling, servicing, 
repairing or parking autos if that person is entitled to workers’ 
compensation benefits. 
3. Anyone employed by you or your spouse who is injured in the 
course of employment.  This exception does not apply to any do- 
mestic employee who is not entitled to any workers’ compensation 
benefits. 
4. Anyone injured while occupying an auto without a reasonable 
belief that he or she had the consent of the owner to do so. 
5. A household member, other than your spouse, while occupying 
or struck by an auto owned or regularly used by you or any 
household member unless a premium for this Part is shown for that 
auto on the Coverage Selections Page. 
6. You or your spouse, if a household member, while occupying or 
struck by an auto owned or regularly used by you or your spouse 
unless a premium for this Part is shown for that auto on the Coverage 
Selections Page. 
We will not pay for expenses incurred more than two years after the 
date of the accident.  We will not pay under this Part for any ex- 
penses that are payable, or would have been payable except for a 
deductible, under the PIP coverage of this policy or any other Mas-

The most we will pay for any one person as a result of any one 
accident is shown on the Coverage Selections Page.  This is the most 
we will pay as the result of a single accident no matter how many 
autos or premiums are shown on the Coverage Selections Page.  
If someone covered under this Part is also entitled to Medical 
Payments coverage under another auto policy issued to you or any 
household member, we will pay only our proportionate share. If 
someone covered under this Part is using an auto he or she does not 
own at the time of the accident, the owner’s automobile Medical 
Payments insurance must pay its limit before we pay. Then, we will 
pay up to the limit shown on your Coverage Selections Page for any 
expenses not covered by that insurance. 
We will not pay benefits under this Part which duplicate payments 
made under the Medical Payments coverage of any other auto policy. 
We must sell you limits of $5,000 per person if you want to buy them.  
Higher limits may be purchased if agreed upon by you and us.  
However, while an auto covered under this Part is being operated in a 
prearranged or organized racing, speed, stunting or demolition contest 
or activity or in practice or preparation for any such contest or activity, 
the most we will pay is the required minimum limits. 
Part 7. 
Under this Part, we will pay for any direct and accidental damage to 
Collision 
your auto caused by a collision.  It does not matter who is at fault.  
We will also pay for collision damage to other private passenger 
autos while being used by you or a household member with the 
consent of the owner.  However, we will not pay for damage to any 
auto which is owned or regularly used by you or a household 
member unless a premium for this Part is shown for that auto on the 
Coverage Selections Page.  We will not pay if an accident occurs 
while an auto covered under this Part is being operated in any 
prearranged or organized racing, speed, stunting or demolition contest 
or activity or in practice or preparation for any such contest or activity. 
We will pay for each loss up to the actual cash value of the auto 
or any of its parts at the time of the collision.  If the repair of a 
damaged part will impair the operational safety of the auto we will 
replace the part.  In all cases we will subtract the deductible amount 
you selected.  Unless you selected a different amount, the law sets 
your deductible at $500. Your deductible is shown on the Coverage 
Selections Page. 
We will not pay for a collision loss for an accident which occurs while

premium on this policy because: 
1. the household member would be classified as an inexperienced 
operator, or 
2.   a higher rating step would be assigned under the Safe Driver 
Insurance Plan. 
You must notify us within 60 days after a person who will operate your 
auto becomes a household member, if that person was not a 
household member on the effective date of your policy.  In the same 
manner, you must notify us if a household member, who will operate 
your auto, becomes a licensed operator. 
If we pay for the total loss of your auto, we will suspend the Collision 
Coverage for that auto until it passes a Motor Vehicle Inspection Test. 
Camper bodies are not covered under this Part unless specifically 
shown on the Coverage Selections Page or by endorsement.  An 
additional premium will be charged for insuring a camper body. 
If an auto covered under this Part is not owned by you at the time  of 
the accident, the owner’s auto insurance must pay its limit before we 
pay.  Then, we will pay, up to the limit shown on your Coverage 
Selections Page, for any damage not covered by that insurance less 
the deductible amount you selected. 
Part 8. 
Under this Part, we will pay in some situations for direct and acci- 
Limited Collision dental damage to your auto caused by a collision. We will also pay

owner.  However, we will not pay for damage to any auto which is

same manner, you must notify us if a household member, who will 
operate your auto, becomes a licensed operator. 
The protection under this Part is not as broad as under Collision 
coverage but the premium is considerably less. 
We only pay under this Part for multiple car accidents in which the 
driver of the auto we are covering was no more than 50% at fault.  We 
will not pay if the owner of the other auto cannot be identified.  After a 
claim under this Part we are required to determine whether the driver 
of the auto we are covering was more than 50% at fault.  We will notify 
you of our determination. 
As long as the driver of the auto covered under this Part was not more 
than 50% at fault, his or her percentage of fault will not affect the 
amount of our payment. 
We will pay for each loss up to the actual cash value of the auto  
or any of its parts at the time of the collision.  If the repair of a 
damaged part will impair the operational safety of the auto we will 
replace the part.  In all cases we will subtract the deductible amount 
you selected.  Unless you selected a different amount, the law sets 
your deductible at $500. Your deductible is shown on the Coverage 
Selections Page. 
We will consider the driver of the auto covered under this Part to be no 
more than 50% at fault if: 
1. That auto was legally parked when struck by another auto. 
2. That auto was struck in the rear by another auto moving in the 
same direction. 
3. The operator of the other auto was convicted of certain violations 
listed in Massachusetts law or any similar law of another state in 
which the accident occurs.  However, we will not pay if the operator of 
the auto covered under this Part was also convicted of one of the 
same violations. 
4. That driver is entitled to recover in court against an identified 
person for some reason other than those listed above.

Camper bodies are not covered under this Part unless specifically

additional premium will be charged for insuring a camper body. 
If an auto covered under this Part is not owned by you at the time  of 
the accident, the owner’s auto insurance must pay its limit before we 
pay.  Then, we will pay, up to the limit shown on your Coverage

the deductible amount you selected. 
Part 9. 
Under this Part, we will pay for direct and accidental damage to or 
Comprehensive 
loss of your auto other than damage caused by collision.  We will 
also pay for such damage or loss to other private passenger autos 
while being used by you or a household member with the consent of 
the owner.  However, we will not pay for such damage or loss to any 
auto which is owned or regularly used by you or a household 
member unless a premium for this Part is shown for that auto on the 
Coverage Selections Page. We will reimburse you for substitute 
transportation expenses if your auto is stolen. 
This Part is not a substitute for Collision (Part 7) or Limited Collision 
(Part 8). 
We consider glass breakage when not involving other collision loss, 
and the following types of losses to be Comprehensive and not 
Collision losses:  losses caused by vandalism, fire and theft, mis- 
siles, falling objects, larceny, explosion, earthquake, windstorm, hail, 
water, flood, malicious mischief, riot or contact with a bird or animal. 
However, we will not pay if an accident occurs while an auto covered 
under this Part is being operated in any prearranged or organized 
racing, speed, stunting or demolition contest or activity or in practice 
or preparation for any such contest or activity. 
We will pay for each loss up to the actual cash value of the auto or 
any of its parts at the time of loss.  If the repair of a damaged part will 
impair the operational safety of the auto we will replace the part.  In all 
cases we will subtract the deductible amount you selected.  Unless 
you selected a different amount, the law sets your deductible at $500.

If you choose not to rent an auto, we will reimburse you up to the

made reasonably available for our inspection within two Registry of 
Motor Vehicles business days following the day you acquired it. We 
may also raise your deductible unless you install an approved anti- 
theft device in the replacement auto. 
Camper bodies are not covered under this Part unless specifically 
shown on the Coverage Selections Page or by endorsement.  An 
additional premium will be charged for insuring a camper body. 
If an auto covered under this Part is not owned by you at the time  
of the accident, the owner’s auto insurance must pay its limit before 
we pay.  Then, we will pay, up to the limit shown on your Coverage 
Selections Page, for any damage or loss not covered by that insur- 
ance less the deductible amount you selected. 
Part 10. 
Under this Part, we will reimburse you in certain situations up to 
Substitute 
the limits shown on your Coverage Selections Page.  We will reim-

replaced.  We will also reimburse you if your auto cannot be used 
because of the kind of damage or loss, including theft, that is cov-
ered under Comprehensive (Part 9). 
We will not make any payments unless you lose the use of your 
auto for at least 24 hours. 
We will pay only for a period of time which is reasonable for having 
your auto repaired or replaced.

If your auto is stolen, you must report the theft to us and the police.  We 
will reimburse you only for transportation expenses incurred after the first 
48 hours following those reports.  We will not pay for transportation 
expenses incurred prior to that time. 
Under Comprehensive (Part 9) there is also substitute transportation 
coverage when your auto is stolen.  If you purchase both Comprehensive 
and $15/$450 limits under this Part, Comprehensive will pay first until its 
coverage is no longer available.  Then this Part will pay. If you purchase 
$30/$900 limits under this Part, the most we will pay under Comprehensive 
(Part 9) and this Part is up to $30 a day to a maximum of $900. 
If you purchase $100/$3,000 limits under this Part, the most we will pay 
under Comprehensive (Part 9) and this Part is up to $100 a day to a 
maximum of $3,000. 
The Coverage here will not duplicate any Comprehensive payments. 
If you choose not to rent an auto, we will reimburse you up to the same 
amounts for taxicab fares, bus fares and other transportation expenses. 
Part 11. 
Under this Part, we will pay up to the limit shown on your Coverage  
Towing and Labor Selections Page for towing and labor costs incurred each time your  auto is disabled. We will pay only for labor done at the scene to the   extent that the labor was needed to get your auto going.  We will  not pay for the cost of repair parts.    
Part 12. 
Sometimes an owner or operator of an auto legally responsible for 
Bodily Injury 
an accident is underinsured. Under this Part, we will pay damages 
Caused By An 
for bodily injury to people injured or killed as a result of certain 
Underinsured Auto accidents caused by someone who does not have enough insurance. 
We will only pay if the injured person is legally entitled to recover from the 
owners or the operators of all underinsured autos.  Such injured person has 
a claim under this Part when the limits for automobile bodily injury liability 
insurance covering the owners and operators of the legally responsible 
autos are: 
1. Less than the limits shown for this Part on your Coverage Selections 
Page; and 
2. Not sufficient to pay for the damages sustained by the injured person. 
We will pay damages to or for:  1. You, while occupying your auto, while occupying an auto you do not 
own, or if injured as a pedestrian.

there are two or more policies which provide coverage at the same limits, 
we will only pay our proportionate share.  We will not pay damages to or for 
any household member who has a Massachusetts auto policy of his or her 
own or who is covered by a Massachusetts auto policy of another 
household member providing underinsured auto insurance with higher 
limits.  3.  Anyone else while occupying your auto.  We will not pay damages to 
or for anyone else who has a Massachusetts auto policy of his or her own 
or who is covered by a Massachusetts auto policy of another household 
member providing underinsured auto coverage. 
4.  Anyone else for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of 
injury to a person covered under this Part. 
If you are injured while occupying your auto and you have two or more 
autos insured with us with different limits, we will only pay up to the limits 
shown on your Coverage Selections Page for the auto you are occupying 
when injured. 
If you are injured as a pedestrian or while occupying an auto you do not 
own and have two or more Massachusetts auto policies which provide 
coverage at different limits, the policy with the higher limits will pay. If there 
are two or more policies which provide coverage at the same limits, we will 
only pay our proportionate share. 
We will not pay to or for: 
1. You, while occupying an auto you own unless a premium charge is 
shown for that auto on your Coverage Selections Page. 
2. Anyone injured while occupying your auto while it is being used as a 
public or livery conveyance.  This does not apply to the use of your auto in 
a share-the-expense car pool arrangement or in an expense reimbursement 
program either as a volunteer or at work 
3. Anyone injured while using an auto without the consent of the owner. 
4. Anyone injured while an auto is being operated in any  prearranged or 
organized racing, speed, stunting or demolition contest or activity or in 
practice or preparation for any such contest or activity. 
5. Any household member if struck by, or while occupying an auto 
owned by that household member which does not have Massachusetts 
compulsory auto insurance. 
We will reduce the damages an injured person is entitled to recover by:

2.   The amount recovered from any legally responsible person provided the 
injured person is fully compensated for his or her damages for bodily injury. 
3.   The amount paid under a workers’ compensation law or similar law. 
4.   Any expenses that are payable or would have been payable, except for a 
deductible, under the PIP coverage of this policy or any other Massachusetts 
auto policy. 
If only one person sustains bodily injury, we will pay any unpaid damages up to 
the difference between the total amount collected from the automobile bodily 
injury liability insurance covering the legally responsible owners and operators of 
all insured autos and the “per person” limit shown for this Part on your Coverage 
Selections Page.  This is the most we will pay for injuries to one or more persons 
as the result of bodily injury to any one person in any one accident. 
Subject to the “per person” limit, if two or more people sustain bodily injury and 
are entitled to coverage under this Part, we will pay any unpaid damages up to 
the difference between the automobile bodily injury liability insurance “per 
accident” limit covering the legally responsible owners and operators and the “per 
accident” limit shown for this Part on your Coverage Selections Page.  This is the 
most we will pay for injuries to two or more people as the result of bodily injury to 
two or more people in any one accident. 
The determination as to whether an injured person is legally entitled to recover 
damages from the legally responsible owner or operator will be by agreement 
between us and the injured person.  The amount of damages, if any, will be 
determined in the same way.  Arbitration will be used if no agreement can be 
reached.  However, in no event may a demand for arbitration constitute first 
notice of claim.  We must be given sufficient notice of claim to conduct a 
reasonable investigation and attempt settlement before arbitration can be filed. 
If an injured person settles a claim as a result of an accident covered under this 
Part, we will pay that person only if the claim was settled with our consent.  We 
will not be bound under this Part by any judgment resulting from a lawsuit 
brought without our written consent. We will not, however, unreasonably withhold 
our consent. 
The limits of two or more autos or policies shall not be added together, combined 
or stacked, to determine the limits of coverage available to anyone covered 
under this Part, regardless of the number of autos involved, persons covered, 
claims made, or premiums shown on the Coverage Selections Page. 
We will not make payments under this Part which duplicate payments under the 
underinsured auto insurance of any other auto policy. 
This Part will not benefit any insurer or self-insurer under a workers’ 
compensation law or any similar law.

General Provisions 
and Exclusions 
This section of the policy contains general provisions which, unless 
otherwise noted, apply to all your coverages. It also describes 
some situations in which policy benefits will not be paid. 
1.  Where You 
Compulsory Bodily Injury To Others (Part 1) only covers accidents 
Are Covered 
in Massachusetts. All the other Parts provide coverage for acci- 
dents and losses which happen in the United States or Canada. We 
consider United States territories and possessions and Puerto Rico 
to be part of the United States.  We will pay for accidents and losses 
which happen while your auto is being transported between ports   
of the United States and Canada.  Your auto is not covered in any 
other country. 
2.  Our Duty To 
We have the right to defend any lawsuit brought against  
Defend You And 
anyone covered under this policy for damages which might be  
Our Right To Settle payable under this policy.  We also have a duty to defend any such 
lawsuit, even if it is without merit, but our duty to defend ends when 
we tender, or pay to any claimant or to a court of competent 
jurisdiction, with the court’s permission, the maximum limits of 
coverage under this policy.  We may end our duty to defend at any 
time during the course of the lawsuit, by tendering, or paying the 
maximum limits of coverage under the policy, without the need for a 
judgment or settlement of the lawsuit or a release by the claimant.  We have the right to settle any claim or lawsuit as we see fit.  If any 
person covered under this policy settles a claim without our con- 
sent, we will not be bound by that settlement.  3. Additional Costs We will pay, in addition to the limits shown for Compulsory and 
We Will Pay 
Optional Bodily Injury To Others (Parts 1 and 5) and Damage to 
Someone Else’s Property (Part 4): 
A. Premiums on appeal bonds and premiums on bonds to release 
attachments for an amount up to the applicable limits you selected  
in any suit we defend. 
B. Interest that accrues after judgment is entered in any suit we 
defend.  We will not pay interest that accrues after we have offered  
to pay up to the limits you selected. 
C. Up to $40 a day for loss of earnings, but not for loss of other 
income, to any person covered under this policy who attends hear- 
ings or trials at our request. 
D. Other reasonable expenses incurred at our request.

4.  What Happens If you die, we will continue coverage for the period of this policy for: 
If You Die 
A. Your spouse, if a resident of your household at your death. 
B. Any legal representative to the extent he or she is responsible 
for maintenance or use of your auto. 
C. Any person having proper temporary custody of your auto. 
5.  Our Right 
Sometimes we may make a payment under this policy to you or to 
To Be Repaid 
someone else who has a separate legal right to recover damages 
from others. In that case, those legal rights may be exercised by us.  
Anyone receiving payment under those circumstances must do 
nothing to interfere with those rights.  He or she must also do what- 
ever is necessary to help us recover for ourselves up to the amount 
we have paid.  If we then recover more than we paid, we will pay 
that person the excess, less his or her proportionate share of the 
costs of recovery, including reasonable attorney’s fees. Any amount 
recovered, because of a payment we make under Part 3 or Part 12 
of this policy, shall first be applied to any unpaid damages due that 
person.  Such unpaid damages must be a part of a claim settled 
with our consent or a part of a judgment resulting from a lawsuit 
brought with our written consent. Any balance then remaining shall 
be applied to the amounts we have paid under Part 3 or Part 12.  
We will reduce the amount we will pay that person by his or her 
proportionate share of the costs of recovery including reasonable 
attorney’s fees. 
Sometimes you or someone else may recover money from the 
person legally responsible for an accident and also receive money 
from us for the same accident.  If so, the amount we paid must be 
repaid to us to the extent that you or someone else recovers. If you 
or someone else recover money from the person legally respon- 
sible for the accident and also receive money from us for the same 
accident as a payment under Part 3 or Part 12 of this policy, we 
must be repaid for any amounts so paid but only to the extent that 
such recovery exceeds any unpaid damages due that person under 
a claim settled with our consent or judgment resulting from a law- 
suit brought with our written consent. 
Whenever we are entitled to repayment from anyone, the amount 
owed us can be reduced by our proportionate share of the costs of 
recovering the money, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. 
In either case we do not have to be repaid for any money we have 
paid under Medical Payments (Part 6).

6.  When You Have 
You may have more than one policy with us covering the same 
More Than One Auto accident.  In that case, the most we will pay is the highest amount 
Policy With Us 
payable under the applicable coverage in any one of those policies.  
However, claims made under Bodily Injury Caused By An Uninsured Auto 
(Part 3) and Bodily Injury Caused By An Underinsured Auto (Part 12) are 
treated differently.  The difference is explained in the description of the 
coverage for that Part. 
7.  If You Go 
Bankruptcy or insolvency of any person covered under this policy 
Bankrupt 
does not relieve us of any of our obligations under this policy. 
8.  We Do Not Pay 
We will not pay under Damage To Someone Else’s Property (Part 
For Nuclear Losses 
4) and Optional Bodily Injury To Others (Part 5) for any person who 
Or War Losses 
is an insured under a nuclear energy liability policy.  The same is true for a 
person who would be an insured under such a policy had it not already 
exhausted its limits.  We will not pay under Medical Payments (Part 6), Collision, Limited 
Collision or Comprehensive (Parts 7, 8 and 9) for losses or damage 
caused by radioactive contamination or by acts of war, insurrection, 
rebellion or revolution or any act incident to any of these. 
9.  We Do Not Pay 
We will not pay for damage to your auto which is due solely to 
For Ordinary 
ordinary wear and tear, freezing, mechanical or electrical failure, or 
Wear Or Tear 
for ordinary road damage to tires.  We will, however, pay for this damage if 
it is the result of some other loss which is covered by this policy. 
10.  If We Pay 
If we pay for the total loss of your auto, we have the right, if we so 
For A Total Loss 
choose, to take title to that auto.  We also have the right, if we so choose, 
to take any damaged part for which we pay. 
11.  Repair And 
Under Collision, Limited Collision and Comprehensive (Parts 7, 8 
Payment After A 
and 9), you must allow us to have the auto appraised after a colli- 
Collision or Loss; 
sion or loss.  If we have a direct payment plan approved by the

you choose not to have your auto repaired, or if we do not receive 
(Parts 7, 8 and 9) 
your Repair Certification Form, or, when requested, you do not make your 
auto available for reinspection within a reasonable period of time following 
repair, our payments automatically reduce the actual cash value of your 
auto if you have further claims. If you later give us proof of proper repair, 
the actual cash value will be increased. 
If you choose not to accept payment under our direct payment plan or we 
do not have such a plan, and you have your auto repaired in accordance 
with the appraisal, you must send us a Completed Work Claim Form.  We 
must pay you within 7 days after receiving the form",general provisions exclusion continued policy cover auto accident case pay high policy payable applicable coverage policy claim bodily injury cause uninsured auto bodily injury cause underinsured auto treat differently difference explain description coverage bankruptcy insolvency person cover policy bankrupt relieve obligation policy pay pay damage property nuclear losses optional bodily injury person war losses insure nuclear energy liability policy true person insure policy exhaust limit pay medical payments collision limited collision comprehensive parts loss damage cause radioactive contamination act war insurrection rebellion revolution act incident pay pay damage auto solely ordinary ordinary wear tear freezing mechanical electrical failure wear tear ordinary road damage tire pay damage result loss cover policy pay pay total loss auto right total loss choose title auto right choose damaged pay repair collision limited collision comprehensive parts payment allow auto appraise collision loss sion loss direct payment plan approve disagree commissioner insurance pay accordance appraisal allow select repair shop choice damage choose auto repair receive parts repair certification form request auto available reinspection reasonable period time follow repair payment automatically reduce actual cash value auto claim later proof proper repair actual cash value increase choose accept payment direct payment plan plan auto repair accordance appraisal send complete work claim form pay day receive form

General Provisions  And Exclusions  (Continued) 
27 If we fail to pay you within 7 days after receipt of the Completed Work 
Claim Form, you have the right to sue us.  If a court decides that we were 
unreasonable in refusing to pay you on time, you are entitled to double the 
amount of damage plus costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees. If you 
request us to, we will pay the repair shop directly, however, the repair shop 
must certify that it meets certain requirements.  If you choose not to have 
your auto repaired, or if we do not receive your Completed Work Claim 
Form, we will determine the amount of decrease in the actual cash value of 
your auto and pay you that amount less your deductible.  Our payment 
automatically reduces the actual cash value of your auto if you have 
further claims. If you later give us proof of proper repair, the actual cash 
value will be increased.  We have a right to inspect all repairs. 
In any event, we will never pay more than what it would cost to repair or 
replace the damaged property. 
Sometimes there may be a disagreement as to the amount of money we 
owe for losses or damage to an auto.  If so, Massachusetts law provides 
for a method of settling the disagreement. Either you or we can, within 60 
days after you file your proof of loss, demand in writing that appraisers be 
selected. The appraisers must then follow a procedure set by law to 
establish the amount of damage. Their decision will be binding on you and 
us. You and we must share the cost of the appraisal. 
12.  Sales Tax 
Under Collision, Limited Collision and Comprehensive (Parts 7, 8 and 9) 
we will pay, subject to your deductible, all sales taxes applicable to the loss 
of an auto or damage to an auto. 
13. Secured Lenders When your Coverage Selections Page shows that a lender has a secured 
interest in your auto, we will make payments under Collision, Limited 
Collision and Comprehensive (Parts 7, 8 and 9) according to the legal 
interests of each party. 
The secured lender’s right of payment will not be invalidated by your acts 
or neglect except that we will not pay if the loss of or damage to your auto 
is the result of conversion, embezzlement, or secretion by you or any 
household member.  Also, we will not pay the secured lender if the loss of 
or damage to your auto is the result of arson, theft or any other means of 
disposal committed by you or at your direction. 
When we pay any secured lender we shall, to the extent of our payment 
have the right to exercise any of the secured lender’s legal rights of 
recovery.  If you do not file a proof of loss as provided in this policy, the 
secured lender must do so within 30 days after the loss or damage 
becomes known to the secured lender.

15.  If Two Or More 
Two or more autos may be insured under this policy.  There may be

different limits for each auto.  If so, when someone covered under 
Under This Policy 
this policy is injured while a pedestrian or is using an auto other than 
your auto at the time of the accident, the most we will pay under any 
applicable Part is the highest limit shown for that Part for any one auto on 
your Coverage Selections Page. 
16.  Trailers 
When a trailer is attached to an auto we consider the auto and trailer 
together to be one auto in applying the limits shown on the Coverage 
Selections Page under Bodily Injury To Others, Damage To Someone 
Else’s Property and Optional Bodily Injury To Others (Parts 1, 4 and 5). 
17.  Premiums 
The premium we will charge for any extension or renewal of this

time of the effective date of the extension or renewal. 
18.  False 
If you or someone on your behalf gives us false, deceptive, mis- 
Information 
leading or incomplete information in any application or policy change 
request and if such false, deceptive, misleading or incomplete information 
increases our risk of loss, we may refuse to pay claims under any or all of 
the Optional Insurance Parts of this policy. Such information includes the 
description and the place of garaging of the vehicles to be insured, the 
names of all household members and customary operators required to 
be listed and the answers given for all listed operators. We may also limit 
our payments to those amounts that we are required to sell under Part 3 
and Part 4 of this policy.  
19.  Changes Which If the information contained in your application changes before this 
Affect Premium 
policy expires, we have the right to adjust your premium to reflect such 
changes. 
20.  Pre-Insurance 
Massachusetts law requires that we inspect certain motor vehicles 
Inspection 
before providing coverage for Collision, Limited Collision, or Com- 
prehensive (Parts 7, 8 or 9).  In some cases, we may defer the required 
inspection of your auto for seven calendar days (not including legal 
holidays) following the effective date of coverage. 
If you do not have your auto inspected within the time allowed, coverage 
for that auto will be automatically suspended.  Your premium will be 
adjusted if the suspension lasts for more than ten days.

reason to worry about. 
You can cancel any of the Optional Insurance Parts at any time by giving 
us or your agent at least twenty days written notice. Because all of the 
Compulsory Insurance Parts are required, you cannot cancel any of them 
separately.  You can, of course, cancel all of the Compulsory Insurance 
Parts by giving us or your agent at least twenty days written notice. 
We can cancel all of any part of this policy including your Compulsory 
Insurance if: 
1. You have not paid your premium on this policy.

sentation when you applied for this policy or any extension or renewal of it.

How The 
This policy is subject to the Safe Driver Insurance Plan.  The Safe 
Safe Driver 
Driver Insurance Plan varies the premium for this policy based 
Insurance Plan 
upon your driver record and that of the other drivers covered by this 
Works 
policy. 
The Plan increases or decreases the premium for this policy 
through the application of rating steps.  The step number assigned 
to your policy determines whether you receive a credit or are as- 
sessed a surcharge. Step 15 is a neutral step. Every step above 15 
results in a higher premium and every step below 15 results in a 
lower premium.  A minimum of two and a maximum of five upward 
steps will be assigned to each surchargeable at-fault accident or 
surchargeable moving traffic violation.  
We will send you a “Safe Driver Insurance Plan Statement” with 
your Coverage Selections Page if this policy is not entitled to a 
maximum credit.

vi  What Insurance is Required by Law  If you own an automobile that is operated on a highway in Ontario, certain insurance coverages are required 
by law. You may also choose to buy additional insurance to extend these coverages to protect against other 
risks. The chart below is only a general summary to give you an idea of the insurance coverages available 
to you. For details of each coverage and the conditions that apply, you should consult the appropriate sections 
of the policy. If there is a difference between the information in this chart and the appropriate section of the

Section 1  Introduction  1.1  
This Policy is Part of a Contract  This policy is part of a contract between you and us. The contract includes three documents: 
 a completed and signed Application for Automobile Insurance, 
 a Certificate of Automobile Insurance, and 
 this policy. 
Under the contract, we agree to provide you with the insurance that is summarized on your Certificate 
of Automobile Insurance, and for which you have agreed to pay a premium.  You only have a particular coverage for a specific automobile if your Certificate of 
Automobile Insurance shows a premium for it or shows the coverage is provided at no cost.  1.2  
Where You Are Covered   This policy covers you and other insured persons for incidents occurring in Canada, the United States 
of America and any other jurisdiction designated in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule, and on 
a vessel travelling between ports of those countries. All of the dollar limits described in this policy are 
in Canadian funds. 
1.3  
Definitions  Automobile 
In this policy, motorized snow vehicle is included in the definition of automobile. 
Regulations may include, or exclude, certain other types or classes of vehicles as automobiles. 
In this policy, there is a difference between a described automobile and the automobile. 
When we refer to an automobile as described, we mean any automobile specifically shown on 
the Certificate of Automobile Insurance.

When we refer to the automobile, we mean: 
 a described automobile, 
 a newly acquired automobile, 
 a temporary substitute automobile, 
 other automobiles driven by you, or driven by your spouse who lives with you, or 
 trailers, in certain circumstances.  These types of automobiles are described more fully in Section 2.  Certificate of Automobile Insurance 
A Certificate of Automobile Insurance is a written document summarizing your insurance 
coverage. It shows your name and/or organization, and the described automobile or 
automobiles.  It lists the coverages purchased, premiums charged, and the period during which 
the insurance is in effect. 
Covered/Coverage 
When we talk of someone or something being covered, we mean that they are protected by 
insurance. When we speak of coverage, we are describing what types of protection they have 
and how much for each type. 
Direct Loss or Damage 
Direct loss or damage refers to damage or loss caused directly by a peril.  This is different 
than an indirect loss.  For example, damage to an automobile resulting from a collision is a 
direct loss.  Loss of the use of an automobile while it is being repaired is an indirect loss. 
Excluded Driver 
An excluded driver is someone specifically not covered by this policy when driving the 
described, temporary substitute or newly acquired automobile(s). The only exception is 
coverage for those Accident Benefits the law requires to be paid to anyone injured in an 
automobile accident in Ontario. 
Named Insured 
The named insured is the person or organization to whom the Certificate of Automobile 
Insurance is issued. 
Occupant 
In this policy, an occupant is a person, including the driver, in or on an automobile, or getting 
into, on, out of, or off an automobile.

Proof of Loss Form 
A proof of loss form records the formal statement concerning a loss for which a claim is 
submitted.  It provides us with all the information we need to determine whether the claim is 
reasonable and the extent of our liability. 
Spouse 
Spouse means either of two persons who: 
 are married to each other; 
 have together entered into a marriage that is voidable or void, in good faith on the part 
of the person making a claim under this policy; or 
 have lived together in a conjugal relationship outside marriage, 
o continuously for a period of not less than three years, or 
o in a relationship of some permanence, if they are the natural or adoptive parents 
of a child. 
We and You 
Throughout this policy the words you and your refer to the person or organization shown on 
the Certificate of Automobile Insurance as the named insured. 
Other people may also be covered under certain conditions.  We call both them and you 
insured persons. 
We, our and us mean the company providing the insurance.  1.4  
Your Responsibilities  If you fail to meet your responsibilities, claims under this policy, with the 
exception of certain Accident Benefits, may be denied.  By accepting this contract you agree to the following conditions.  1.4.1 
You agree to notify us promptly in writing of any significant change of which you are 
aware in your status as a driver, owner or lessee of a described automobile.  You also 
agree to let us know of any change that might increase the risk of an incident or affect our 
willingness to insure you at current rates. 
You must promptly tell us of any change in information supplied in your original 
application for insurance, such as additional drivers, or a change in the way a described 
automobile is used. 
1.4.2 
You agree to inform us of any sale or transfer of your interest in a described automobile 
except through change of title by succession, death or proceedings under the Bankruptcy 
and Insolvency Act (Canada).

You agree not to use or allow anyone to use the automobile in a race or speed test or for

Where to Make A Claim and Who May Make It  Warning – Offences 
It is an offence under the Insurance Act to knowingly make a false or 
misleading statement or representation to an insurer in connection with the 
person’s entitlement to a benefit under a contract of insurance, or to 
wilfully fail to inform the insurer of a material change in circumstances 
within 14 days, in connection with such entitlement. The offence is 
punishable on conviction by a maximum fine of $250,000 for the first 
offence and a maximum fine of $500,000 for any subsequent conviction. 
It is an offence under the federal Criminal Code for anyone to knowingly 
make or use a false document with the intent it be acted on as genuine and 
the offence is punishable, on conviction, by a maximum of 10 years 
imprisonment.  
It is an offence under the federal Criminal Code for anyone, by deceit, 
falsehood, or other dishonest act, to defraud or to attempt to defraud an 
insurance company. The offence is punishable, on conviction, by a 
maximum of 14 years imprisonment for cases involving an amount over 
$5,000 or otherwise a maximum of 2 years imprisonment.  You or other insured persons must notify us of a claim and provide proof of the claim.  This may be 
done in person or by registered mail addressed to our chief agent or head office in Ontario.

Our Rights and Responsibilities  1.6.1 
Payment of Claims  We will pay legitimate claims within 60 days of receiving a proof of loss.  Some claims 
for Accident Benefits will be paid sooner. 
If we refuse to pay a claim, we will notify the insured person in writing explaining the 
reasons why we are not liable to pay.  1.6.2 
If You Have Been Incorrectly Classified and Your Premium is Wrong  We use rules that determine the amount you pay for each coverage and category of 
automobile insurance.  You are classified according to these rules.  If you have been incorrectly classified, we will correct the situation.  If the incorrect classification resulted in your paying too high a premium, we will refund 
any premium overpayment with interest.  The interest will cover the period for which you 
were overcharged.  The rate of interest will be the bank rate, as set by the Bank of Canada, on the first day of 
the last month of the quarter preceding the quarter in which you were incorrectly 
classified. If the bank rate includes a fraction we will round it off to the next highest 
number.  (The bank rate is the rate at which the Bank of Canada makes short-term loans to 
chartered banks.)  If the incorrect classification resulted in your paying too low a premium, we will require 
you to pay an additional premium as long as we tell you within 60 days of the effective 
date of the policy. We will not charge you interest on the additional premium.  1.6.3 
Monthly Premium Payment Option  The law may allow you to pay your premium in equal monthly payments.  If so, we may 
charge you interest at a rate determined by the provincial government under the Insurance 
Act (Ontario).

Cancelling Your Insurance  1.7.1 
When You Cancel  You may cancel your insurance at any time by advising us.  If you cancel, we will calculate the premium you owe on a short rate basis. Short rate 
means that the premium you owe will include our handling costs.  We will refund 
anything due to you as soon as possible.  There may be a minimum premium set out in your Certificate of Automobile Insurance. 
This will not be refunded.  1.7.2 
When We Cancel  Where your policy has been in effect for up to 60 days, we may only cancel your policy 
for a reason that we have filed with the Financial Services Commission of Ontario.  Where your policy has been in effect for more than 60 days, we may only cancel your 
policy for one of the following reasons:   non-payment of premium, 
 you have given false particulars of the automobile to our prejudice, 
 you have knowingly misrepresented or failed to disclose information that you were 
required to provide in the application for automobile insurance, or 
 the risk has changed materially.  If we cancel your policy, we will calculate the premium you owe on a proportionate basis. 
Proportionate means you will pay for the actual number of days you were covered. For 
example, if half the premium period is over, you will pay half the premium.  There may be a minimum premium shown on your Certificate of Automobile Insurance. 
This will not be refunded.  If you have paid more than the premium you owe, we will refund the difference on 
cancellation. Your refund may be delayed if the amount of premium you owe is subject to 
adjustment, or we are waiting for reports in order to determine the premium paid or owing.  
We will make the refund as soon as possible in that case.

How We Can Cancel for Non-payment of Premium  In case of non-payment of premium, we may give you a notice in writing.  We must give 
you ten days notice if we deliver the notice in person, or 30 days notice by sending the 
notice by registered mail to your last known address.  The 30-day period starts on the 
second day after we mail the registered letter.  The notice will inform you that you have 
until noon of the business day before the last day of the notice period to pay the arrears, 
plus an administration fee, failing which the policy will automatically be cancelled 
effective at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the notice period. If you pay the arrears and the 
administration fee in time, then your policy will not be cancelled.  But if we have already given you two notices of non-payment of premium during the term 
of your policy and a non-payment occurs again, we don’t have to give you another notice 
under this section; instead we may cancel your policy as described in section 1.7.4.  1.7.4 
How We Can Cancel for Repeated Non-payment or Other Reasons  If we cancel your insurance for non-payment of premium because we have already given 
you two notices during the term of your policy as described in section 1.7.3, or if we 
cancel for any other reason, we will notify you in writing. We must give you five days 
notice if we deliver the notice of cancellation in person, or 15 days notice by sending the 
notice of cancellation by registered mail to your last known address. The 15-day period 
starts on the second day after we mail the registered letter.  If the notice was given because 
we have already given you two notices of non-payment during the term of your policy as 
described in section 1.7.3, we are under no obligation to accept a late payment or to keep 
the policy in force after the effective date of cancellation.

Special Conditions: Any trailer you own and that is not described in this policy is also 
covered for Direct Compensation - Property Damage Coverage under the following 
conditions:   If it is attached to an automobile with a GVWR of not more than 4,500 kilograms, 
or if not attached, it is normally used with an automobile with a GVWR of not 
more than 4,500 kilograms.   It is not designed or used for living in, to carry passengers, or for commercial 
purposes.  2.3 
When You Have Insured Two Or More Automobiles  2.3.1 
Under the Same Policy  When more than one automobile is described on your Certificate of Automobile Insurance, 
we will treat each automobile as if it were insured by a separate policy for claims resulting 
from its use or operation.  However, in the case of an incident involving an automobile you don't own, we will only 
pay up to the highest limit that applies to any one automobile described in this policy.  Example  Your automobile policy has Liability Coverage on two automobiles for $300,000 and 
$500,000 respectively. If you are driving someone else's automobile and are involved 
in an accident, the most we would pay is $500,000.  2.3.2 
Under More Than One Policy  When you have two or more automobiles insured as described automobiles under two or 
more policies, each automobile will be covered by its respective policy.  However, determining how much we will pay is more complicated if there is an incident in 
an automobile you don't own.  The amount we will pay under this policy for any incident will be a fraction of the highest 
policy limit.  This fraction will be the proportion that the limit under this policy bears to 
the total of the limits of all the policies.  In no case will we pay more than this proportion of the highest limit.

don't own, here is how we will calculate the amount we will pay.  Step 1. What is the total of the limits of all the policies?   
200,000 (limit under Policy A) 
+ 
300,000 (limit under Policy B)  500,000 (total under both policies)  Step 2. What is the proportion of the limit under Policy A to the total from Step 1?   
200,000 (limit under Policy A) 
= 
2  500,000 (total under both policies)  5  Step 3. What is the most we will pay under this policy?   
2 x 300,000 (highest policy limit)  
=  
120,000  5  The most we would pay would be 2/5 of the loss, but never more than $120,000, 2/5 
of the highest policy limit.  The other policy will pay the remaining 3/5 of the loss to 
a maximum of $180,000.  2.4  Trailers and Towing  2.4.1 
Trailers  An automobile pulling one or more trailers will be treated as a single automobile when 
determining how much we will pay under Liability, Accident Benefits and Uninsured 
Automobile Coverages. However, they will be treated as separate automobiles when 
determining the deductibles and how much we will pay under Direct Compensation - 
Property Damage and optional Loss or Damage Coverages.  2.4.2 
Automobiles in Tow  We may inspect the automobile at any reasonable time.  If you do not co-operate in any 
incident involving two or more automobiles owned by different persons and attached to each 
other, the insurer of each automobile will compensate its insured for losses according to the 
terms of the Direct Compensation - Property Damage and optional Loss or Damage 
coverages.

Page 18    Section 3  Liability Coverage  You only have a particular coverage for a specific automobile if your Certificate 
of Automobile Insurance shows a premium for it or shows the coverage is 
provided at no cost.  3.1 
Introduction  This Section of your policy provides coverage for amounts that the law holds you or other insured 
persons responsible for bodily injuries or losses others suffer in an automobile incident.  3.2 
Who is Covered  You are covered when you, or anyone else in possession of a described automobile with your consent, 
uses or operates it. We will consider these other people insured persons.  Your Liability Coverage applies when you or others use or operate certain other 
types of automobiles. See Section 2 for details and additional conditions.  3.3 
What We Cover  You or other insured persons may be legally responsible for the bodily injury to, or death of others, or 
for damage to the property of others as a result of owning, leasing or operating the automobile or 
renting or leasing another automobile.  In these cases, we will make any payment on your or other 
insured persons' behalf that the law requires, up to the limits of the policy.  We will also reimburse anyone covered by this policy for costs involved in providing immediate 
medical aid needed by someone hurt in an automobile incident.  When we receive notice of loss or damage caused to persons or property we will investigate. We may 
then negotiate a settlement on behalf of you or other insured persons.  3.3.1 
If Someone Sues You  By accepting this policy you and other insured persons irrevocably appoint us to act on your or 
their behalf in any lawsuit against you or them in Canada, the United States of America or any 
other jurisdiction designated in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule arising out of the 
ownership, use or operation of the automobile.

If someone sues you or other insured persons insured by this Section for losses suffered in an 
automobile incident, we will provide a defence and cover the costs of that defence, including 
investigation costs. We will pay all legal costs the court assesses against you and other insured 
persons in the lawsuit we have defended.  If there is a judgment against you or other insured persons, we will pay any post-judgment 
interest owed on that part of the amount the court orders that falls within the liability limits of 
your policy.  We reserve the right to investigate, negotiate and settle any claim out of court if we choose.  If you are sued for more than the limits of your policy, you may wish to hire, at your 
cost, your own lawyer to protect yourself against the additional risk.  3.3.2 
How Much We Will Pay  The most we will pay on your behalf and on behalf of all other insured persons insured by this 
Section, for any one incident (over and above legal costs and post-judgment interest) will be 
determined by the extent of your coverage.  The limit under your policy is shown on the 
Certificate of Automobile Insurance.  Example  You are sued for injuries suffered by another person in an accident that you are 
legally responsible for. We will hire lawyers at our expense and cover all costs of 
your defence in court.  The court orders you to pay $10,000 in costs and $600,000 to cover losses. Your 
liability limit is $500,000.  We will cover the $10,000 in costs, and $500,000 of the judgment.  We will also pay 
any interest owed on that amount from the day of the judgment.  You will be 
responsible for the remaining $100,000 of the judgment and any interest owed on 
that.

Outside Ontario  If the incident happens in a jurisdiction covered by this policy in which the minimum liability 
coverage required is higher than the limit shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance, 
we will honour the higher amount.  We also agree not to use any legal defence that would not 
be available if the policy had been issued in that jurisdiction.  Example  You have an accident in a province where the minimum liability coverage required is 
$500,000. Even though you are only carrying $200,000 worth of liability insurance, 
we will pay up to $500,000.  3.3.4 
If There is More Than One Named Insured Under This Policy  We will protect you and others named as insured by this policy, for claims made against each 
other. In such cases, we will act as if a separate policy was issued to each named insured.  
However, the total amount we will pay (over and above legal costs and post-judgment interest) 
cannot exceed the maximum coverage shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance.  Example  Two people are in business together. Both are named in the insurance policy covering 
their van. They have bought Liability Coverage of $500,000.  One day, there is an accident while one is driving and the other is a passenger. Both 
of them are severely injured as a result of their combined negligence.  They sue each other and one is awarded $300,000 and the other $500,000. The 
combined amount we will pay will not be more than the policy limit of $500,000 plus 
legal costs and post-judgment interest.  3.3.5 
Rented and Leased Automobiles  For convenience in this subsection we use the terms rent, renter and rented as equivalent to 
lease, lessee and leased.  This policy provides coverage for persons who rent an automobile, as described in the 
definitions of automobile in Section 2, as a result of liability imposed by law arising from the 
negligence of the driver of that automobile.

Page 21    If a liability claim is made against a driver, renter or owner of a rented automobile, coverage 
may be available under more than one motor vehicle liability policy.  The following rules 
govern the order in which the policies will respond:  1. 
If insurance is available to the person who rented the automobile, the policy providing 
that insurance responds first. 
2. 
If insurance is available to the driver of the rented automobile, the policy providing that 
insurance responds next. 
3. 
If insurance is available to the owner of the rented automobile, the policy providing that 
insurance responds last.  We have no liability for such claims in excess of the limit of liability coverage specified in the 
Certificate of Automobile Insurance and do not have the responsibility to defend such claims 
against anyone other than you, your spouse who lives with you, or the persons mentioned in 
subsections 2.2.3 (6) and 2.2.4 (6).  Example #1*  You rent a car and your friend is driving it when an accident occurs in Ontario. You, 
your friend, and the rental company may face claims by other people who have 
sustained a loss in the accident. If insurance is available to you under your policy for 
such claims and your friend was at fault for the accident, then your policy would be 
first in line to pay those people. If that coverage were used up, and if insurance is 
available to your friend under his or her policy, your friend’s insurer would pay next. 
If that coverage were used up, any insurance available under the rental company’s 
policy would then pay. None of the insurers has to pay more than the limit of 
coverage that it agreed to provide.  Example #2*  Your friend rents a car and you are driving it when an accident occurs in Ontario. 
You, your friend, and the rental company may face claims by other people who have 
sustained a loss in the accident. If you were at fault for the accident and insurance is 
available to your friend under his or her policy for such claims, then your friend’s 
insurer would be first in line to pay those people. If that coverage were used up, and if 
insurance is available to you under your policy, then your insurer would pay next. If 
that coverage were used up, any insurance available under the rental company’s 
                                                           
*These examples are provided as a convenience only, to illustrate the operation of section 277 of the Insurance Act (Ontario).  If 
there is a discrepancy between section 277 and these examples, section 277 prevails.  In addition, whether or not insurance is 
available under a policy in any given situation depends on the facts of that situation and the terms of the particular policy.

Your and Other Insured Persons' Responsibilities  You and other insured persons agree:   to notify us in writing within seven days of any incident involving loss or damage to persons 
or property (or, if unable because of incapacity, as soon as possible after that), giving us full 
details of the incident and any claim arising from it; 
 if requested, to give us a statutory declaration that the claim arose out of the use or operation of 
the automobile and that you or other insured persons were using, operating or responsible for 
the operation of it; 
 to help us obtain all necessary information and evidence about the incident, including the 
attendance of witnesses, and to cooperate, but not financially, in any legal actions if we ask; 
 to send immediately to us everything received in writing concerning the claim, including legal 
documents; and 
 not to assume any liability for the incident, or settle any claim, except at your or other insured 
persons' own cost, and not to interfere in any legal proceeding or in any negotiations we 
conduct to settle any claim.  We may, on occasion, be required by law to make payments, even though we are not otherwise 
liable for them under this policy.  If so, you or other insured persons will have to reimburse us 
upon demand for those payments.  3.5 
Other Limitations On Your Coverage  3.5.1  
Property Not Covered  Under this Section, we won't cover claims for damage to property carried in or upon the 
automobile, or claims for damage to other property owned or rented by, or in the care,

insured persons may be entitled to receive if injured or killed in an automobile accident.  If there is a 
difference between the interpretation of the wording in this Section and the interpretation of the

after that as possible. We will send you or other insured persons an application for Accident

assess your needs.  We may ask you or other insured persons to provide additional information in connection with 
the claim, such as a statutory declaration as to the circumstances that gave rise to the 
application, or proof of identity. We can also ask you or other insured persons to attend an 
examination under oath in connection with entitlement to benefits, on reasonable advance 
notice and at a time and place that are convenient to the person. If the person does not 
participate as requested, benefits may be delayed or suspended.  If the injuries fall within certain guidelines issued by the Superintendent of Financial Services,

insurance is not collectible. However, this does not include an automobile owned by or 
registered in the name of the insured person or their spouse.  5.1.3 What is an Unidentified Automobile?  An unidentified automobile is one whose owner or driver cannot be determined.  5.2 
What We Will Cover  5.2.1 Claims by You or Other Insured Persons for Bodily Injury  We will pay any amounts you or other insured persons have a legal right to recover as damages

deductible, we will pay up to $25,000.  Note: Damage to the automobile caused by an unidentified automobile is 
not covered under this Section, but optional Loss or Damage Coverages 
may be available.  5.3

5.3.6 Medical Examinations May Be Required  You or other insured persons may be required to undergo examinations by a qualified medical 
or psychological advisor at reasonable intervals.  When we require an examination, we will give 
reasonable notice.  We will pay for any examination we require.  The person making the claim, or their 
representative, is entitled to a copy of the medical report, if requested.  5.4 
Claims for Property Damage  5.4.1 Who is Covered?  In a claim for damage to the automobile, the owner of the automobile is covered for damage.  In a claim for damage to the contents of the automobile, the owner of the contents is covered for 
damage.  5.4.2 Conditions Applying to Claims for Property Damage  When making a claim for property damage, you and other insured persons must:   notify us in writing within seven days of the accident (or, if unable because of 
incapacity, as soon as possible after that), giving us the best information available at that 
time concerning the loss or damage and circumstances. 
 do as much as is reasonably possible to protect the automobile from further damage.  We 
will pay for any reasonable protection provided.  Further damage resulting from failure 
to provide reasonable protection will not be covered by this policy. 
 make no repairs beyond those needed for protection of the automobile, or remove 
evidence of the damage, without our written consent or until we have had time to inspect 
the automobile. 
 allow us to copy all documents in your or other insured persons' possession that relate to 
the accident. 
 permit us to inspect the automobile at any reasonable time. 
 complete a statutory declaration within 90 days of the accident, if requested. The

5.4.3 Our Right to Repair, Replace or Rebuild the Automobile  We have the right to repair, replace or rebuild the automobile rather than pay for the damage.  If 
we choose to do this, we will let you or other insured persons know in writing within seven days 
of receiving notice of the claim.  We will complete the work within a reasonable time using 
parts of similar kind and quality.  5.4.4 How Much We Will Pay  The most we will pay for the automobile is its actual cash value at the time it was damaged, less 
the deductible specified in your Certificate of Automobile Insurance.  The value of the loss or damage is based on actual cash value after taking into account 
depreciation. We will not pay more to repair the automobile than its actual cash value at the time 
it was damaged, less the deductible specified in your Certificate of Automobile Insurance.  We will pay the lower of the following:   the cost to repair the loss or damage, less the deductible; or 
 the actual cash value of the automobile at the time it was damaged, less the applicable 
deductible.  Example  Your car is four years old and is hit on the front left side by an identified but 
uninsured automobile.  The damaged part of the body of your car is repaired. 
We will pay the cost of the repairs, less the $300 deductible, including new 
paint for the damaged part of your automobile.  If you want the entire car 
repainted, you will have to pay the cost of painting the rest of the car.  5.5 
Claims for Both Bodily Injury and Property Damage  An accident may result in a valid claim for both bodily injury or death and for damage to the 
automobile or its contents.  In that case, payments for bodily injury and death have priority on 95% of 
the total amount payable.  Payment for damage to the automobile or contents will have priority on 5%.  Example  An accident in Ontario for which an identified but uninsured driver is 
responsible destroys your $20,000 car, and results in injuries to you and your 
spouse, totalling $350,000.  We will not pay more than the minimum liability limit of $200,000. Of that 
money, 95%, or $190,000, will go toward payment for bodily injury.  The

remaining 5%, or $10,000, will apply to the loss of your car.  5.6 
Settling a Claim  5.6.1 By Agreement  Questions about whether a claim is valid, and the amount of any payment, can be decided by 
agreement between us and you or other insured persons making the claim.  5.6.2 By Arbitration  If there is a disagreement, the matter may be settled by arbitration if you or other insured 
persons ask for it or if we ask for it and you agree.  The arbitrator will be an individual 
acceptable to us and you or other insured persons. If both sides can't agree on an arbitrator, then 
each side will name an arbitrator.  The two arbitrators will then appoint a third. A decision 
supported by at least two of the three will be binding. All arbitrations will be governed by the 
Arbitration Act, 1991 (Ontario).  5.6.3 In Court  The matter may be decided in a lawsuit brought against us by you or other insured persons in an 
Ontario court. If so, we have the right to ask the court to decide who is legally responsible and 
the amount of compensation owing, unless another Ontario court has already done so in an 
action that was defended.  5.7 
Limitations and Exceptions  5.7.1 Payment Limits  1. We will not pay more than the minimum limits for automobile liability insurance in 
the jurisdiction in which the accident happens. This amount applies regardless of the 
number of persons injured or killed, or the damage to the automobile and contents.  
In no event will we pay more than the minimum liability limits required in Ontario.  Example  You are travelling in a car outside Ontario when you are injured in an accident 
for which an uninsured driver is responsible. The minimum liability limit in that 
jurisdiction is $100,000.  Your injuries are serious and are assessed at $300,000 
or more.  We will pay no more than $100,000.

contents.   any amount over $25,000 in any one accident for damage to the automobile 
and its contents.   for loss or damage while a person specifically excluded from this policy is 
driving the automobile.  5.7.2 Limit Where More Than One Policy Applies  You or other insured persons may have a right to claim benefits from more than one automobile 
insurance policy covering accidents involving uninsured or unidentified automobiles.  In that 
case, anyone making a claim under this or any other coverage may only recover once for the 
same loss.  5.8 
If You or Other Insured Persons Start a Lawsuit  5.8.1 Send Us the Documents  You or other insured persons or your representatives may decide to sue the owner, driver or 
operator of another automobile involved in the accident.  In that case, a copy of the documents 
initiating the lawsuit must be provided to us as soon as the action is started. The documents must 
be delivered, or sent by registered mail, to our chief agent or head office in Ontario.  5.8.2 If You or Other Insured Persons Win, But Can't Recover Payment  If the court awards compensation but you or other insured persons can't recover from the person

insured persons have been paid and the full amount awarded by the court.  What we pay, of course, is subject to the limits and conditions applying to coverage for 
accidents involving uninsured or unidentified automobiles.  5.8.3 Assignment of the Award  We may require you or other insured persons, or your representatives, to assign to us the amount

have already paid, we will reimburse the difference, minus our costs.  5.9

Page 36    Section 6  Direct Compensation - Property Damage Coverage   
You only have a particular coverage for a specific automobile if your 
Certificate of Automobile Insurance shows a premium for it or shows the 
coverage is provided at no cost.  6.1 
Introduction  This Section of your policy covers damage to the automobile and certain trailers not shown on the 
Certificate of Automobile Insurance, their equipment, contents, and loss of use of the automobile or 
contents caused by another person's use or operation of an automobile in Ontario.  The coverage under this Section applies only if the accident takes place in Ontario and at least one 
other automobile involved is insured under a motor vehicle liability policy.  The policy covering the 
other automobile must be issued by an insurance company licensed in Ontario, or one that has filed 
with the Financial Services Commission of Ontario to provide this coverage.  It is called direct compensation because you will collect from us, your insurance company, even 
though you, or anyone else using or operating the automobile with your consent, were not entirely at 
fault for the accident.   6.2 
What We Will Cover  We will pay the cost of damage to the automobile, its equipment, contents and for loss of use of the 
automobile or contents arising from an accident for which another person would have been legally 
responsible in the absence of section 263 of the Insurance Act (Ontario).  Section 263 takes away your 
right to sue the other person for these losses.  We will pay no more to repair or replace the automobile 
or property than its actual cash value at the time it was damaged, less the applicable percentage of the 
deductible shown on your Certificate of Automobile Insurance.  If a part needed to repair the automobile is no longer available, we will pay an amount equal to the 
manufacturer's latest list price for the part.  Note:  You should be aware that this coverage does not apply if the automobile is described in 
another motor vehicle liability policy.

Page 37    Example  You are driving a friend's car.  That car is described in your friend's motor 
vehicle liability policy.  You have an accident for which you are not at fault.   Your friend will claim under the direct compensation property damage 
provisions of his or her motor vehicle liability policy for the loss.  We will not pay for damage to, or loss of use of, contents that are being carried for reward.  6.3 
Who is Covered  In a claim for damage to the automobile, the owner of the automobile is covered for damage.  In a claim for damage to the contents of the automobile, the owner of the contents is covered for 
damage.  6.4 
How Much We Will Pay  6.4.1 Determining Fault  The amount we pay under this Section of your policy will be determined by the degree to 
which you or the driver were not at fault in the accident.  Responsibility for an accident is determined by the Insurance Act (Ontario) and the Fault 
Determination Rules. These may find you or the driver wholly or partially responsible.  The degree of responsibility is expressed as a percentage.  6.4.2 The Deductible  The amount we pay may be subject to a Direct Compensation - Property Damage deductible. 
The deductible is the amount you agree to pay toward the cost of any single claim you make 
under this Section.  The deductible, if any, is the amount shown on the Certificate of 
Automobile Insurance, multiplied by the percentage to which you or the driver of the 
automobile were not at fault for the accident.  You are not permitted to sue anyone (for 
instance the at-fault motorist) to recover this deductible.  If you have damage to both your automobile and its contents, the deductible will first be 
applied to your automobile loss.  If there is any remaining deductible, the remainder will be 
applied to the contents loss.  You will need to make a separate claim for each accident that causes damage.  The deductible 
applies each time you make a claim and separately to each automobile that is insured.

the driver of the automobile were not at fault for the accident, less the applicable Direct 
Compensation-Property Damage deductible.  Example #1  
(the other driver is entirely responsible)  Your car has an actual cash value of $12,000. You are involved in an accident 
for which someone else is 100% responsible.  Your car is a total loss.  Your Direct Compensation - Property Damage (DC-PD) deductible is $500.  
We will pay $11,500 ($12,000 less $500, the deductible). We will also pay for 
reasonable alternate transportation.  In sum: You receive $11,500.  You are responsible for $500, the DC-PD 
deductible.  Example #2 
(you are partly responsible - no optional Loss or Damage Coverages)  Your car has an actual cash value of $12,000. You are involved in an accident 
and are 25% responsible. Your car is a total loss.  Your Direct Compensation - Property Damage (DC-PD) deductible is $300. 
Under DC-PD, we cover the damages (less the deductible) for which the other 
driver would have otherwise been responsible. You are responsible for the 
deductible. We will pay $8,775 ($9,000 -- being 75% of the value of your 
automobile -- less $225 -- being 75% of the deductible).  In sum: You receive $8,775. You are responsible for $225 (the DC-PD 
deductible), and will have to pay the remainder out of your own pocket.  In this 
example, you will be out-of-pocket for a total of $3,225. (However, you may be 
entitled to recover part of that amount if you have bought additional optional

(damage to automobile and contents)  You are involved in an accident for which you are not responsible. The repair of 
your car costs $250. Contents worth $125 are destroyed.  Your Direct Compensation - Property Damage (DC-PD) deductible is $300. We 
will pay $0 ($250 less $250) toward your car damage, and $75 ($125 less $50)

Your and Other Insured Persons' Responsibilities  When making a claim for property damage, you and other insured persons must:   notify us in writing within seven days of any accident (or, if unable, because of incapacity, as

 permit us to inspect the automobile at any reasonable time.   complete a statutory declaration within 90 days of the accident, if requested. The declaration 
will describe what happened in detail, the cause and amount of the loss, those affected and 
how, and state that the loss was truly accidental. We will also need to know if any other 
insurance is involved.   not leave us to dispose of the automobile unless we agree to accept it.  If we decide to replace 
the automobile or pay its actual cash value, less the applicable deductible, we own the salvage.  6.6 
Our Right to Repair, Replace or Rebuild the Automobile  We have the right to repair, replace or rebuild the automobile rather than pay for the damage.  If we 
choose to do this, we will let you or other insured persons know in writing within seven days of 
receiving notice of the claim.  We will complete the work within a reasonable time using parts of 
similar kind and quality.  6.7 
Other Limitations on Your Coverage  6.7.1 Contamination of Property  Under this Section, we won't cover claims arising from contamination of property carried in 
the automobile.  6.7.2 Nuclear Hazards  Nuclear energy hazards means radioactive, toxic, explosive or other hazardous properties of 
substances described in Regulations made under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (Canada).  If you or other insured persons are involved in an accident where the loss or damage is directly 
or indirectly caused by a nuclear hazard, we will pay up to $200,000 if you or other insured 
persons are covered under this policy for a nuclear hazard and you or other insured persons are

that policy have been paid out.  6.7.3 Settling a Claim  If you disagree with the degree of fault attributed to you under the Fault Determination Rules 
or with the amount of any proposed settlement, you can bring a law suit against us to have the 
matter determined by a judge.  Alternatively, if the disagreement is over the value of the vehicle or its contents or the nature, 
amount or cost of any repairs or the amount we should pay, the matter can be settled by an 
appraisal under the Insurance Act, if you ask for it or if we ask for it and you agree. You and 
we will each appoint an appraiser, who will either agree on the award or, if they disagree, will 
appoint an umpire to decide as between their respective positions.

Page 41    Section 7  Loss or Damage Coverages 
(Optional)  You only have a particular coverage for a specific automobile if your Certificate 
of Automobile Insurance shows a premium for it or shows the coverage is 
provided at no cost.  7.1 
Introduction  7.1.1 Coverage for Loss of or Damage to Your Automobile  We agree to pay for direct and accidental loss of, or damage to, a described automobile and its 
equipment caused by a peril such as fire, theft, or collision if the automobile is insured against 
these perils.  By direct loss or damage we mean loss or damage resulting directly from a peril for which 
coverage has been purchased.  This Section applies only to the extent that a claim for damage to an automobile and its 
equipment would not be covered by Section 6, Direct Compensation - Property Damage 
Coverage of a motor vehicle liability policy.  We may inspect the described vehicle and its equipment at any reasonable time. If you do not 
co-operate with any reasonable arrangements for inspection, your coverages under this Section 
may be cancelled and any claims under this Section may be denied.  Your Loss or Damage Coverages may apply to types of automobiles other than 
described automobiles.  See Section 2 for details and additional conditions.  7.1.2 Coverage Options  You may choose from among the four types of protection listed below.  Your choice will be 
shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance.  Note: All of the following coverages are subject to 7.2.

Example  We will not pay for a tire blow-out in normal driving, but if the tire is destroyed 
in a collision and you have Collision or Upset Coverage, we will cover that loss 
up to the value of your tire at the time of the incident.  We won't pay for loss or damage:   resulting from a dishonest claim of ownership, illegal disposal, or theft of the 
automobile by anyone who has legal possession of it under a written agreement (a 
mortgage, conditional sale, lease or other similar agreement);   resulting from a change in ownership that is agreed to, even if that change was brought 
about by trickery or fraud;  Example  Late one evening at a party, you sell your car to a stranger in return for a 
cheque. A week later the cheque bounces. We will not cover the loss.   caused by radioactive contamination;   to contents of automobiles and trailers, other than their equipment; and   in excess of $25 for recorded material and equipment for use with a playing or

activity;   if you drive the automobile while not authorized by law; and   if another person, with your permission, drives or operates the automobile under any of 
these conditions.  7.2.3 Certain Thefts Not Covered  We won't pay under either the Comprehensive or Specified Perils coverages for loss or 
damage caused when a person who lives in your household steals the automobile.  We also won't pay under these coverages for loss or damage caused when an employee of 
yours steals the automobile and the employee's duties include driving, maintaining or repairing 
the automobile.  This applies at any time, and not simply during working hours.  7.3 
The Deductible  The amount we pay to cover any losses may be subject to a deductible.  The deductible is the amount 
you agree to pay toward the cost of any single claim you make under this Section.  The deductible, if 
any, is shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance.  You will need to make a separate claim for each incident that causes loss or damage.  The deductible 
applies each time you make a claim and separately to each automobile that is insured.  We will only pay for loss or damage that exceeds the amount of the deductible.  If your claim is one to 
which Section 6, Direct Compensation - Property Damage (DC-PD) Coverage also applies, the 
amount we will pay under this Section will not include the DC-PD deductible that applies to the 
claim. Your deductible under this Section will be the Collision deductible multiplied by the 
percentage to which you or the driver of the automobile were at fault for the accident.  Example #1  You have Comprehensive Coverage, and your deductible is $500. Your car's 
windshield is broken by a fallen tree. You are responsible for the first $500 of 
the cost of the windshield replacement. Any claim less than $500 will be your 
responsibility.

(you are fully responsible - with optional Loss or Damage Coverages)  Your car has an actual cash value of $12,000. You are involved in an accident 
and are 100% responsible. Your car is a total loss.  You receive nothing under your Direct Compensation - Property Damage 
Coverage.  You have the optional Collision or Upset Coverage and your deductible is $500. 
Under the optional coverage, we will pay $11,500 ($12,000 less $500, the

deductible.

Under DC-PD, we will pay $3,525 ($3,750 -- being 75% of $5,000 --less $225

$350.  If you are insured for loss or damage caused by fire or lightning, there is no deductible for these 
losses.  7.4 
Additional Benefits  Whatever Loss or Damage Coverage you choose under this Section, your coverage will include the 
following additional benefits.  7.4.1 Payment of Charges  We will pay general average, salvage and fire department charges and any Canadian or U.S. 
customs duties for which you are legally responsible as a result of an insured peril.  Example  Your car is damaged in a fire.  The fire department properly bills you for the 
cost of putting out the fire. A new transmission must be imported before the car 
can be repaired. We will pay the fire department's bill, import duties on the 
replacement part and for the parts and repairs themselves.  In this instance, salvage means any expense involved in recovering property to prevent loss 
from an insured peril.  General average charges may arise when a described automobile is shipped by water. If it 
becomes necessary to dump a portion of the ship's cargo overboard to save the ship, you may 
be legally responsible for a share of the resulting losses. We will cover that expense.

Page 47    7.4.2 Foregoing Our Right to Recover  If someone else is using a described automobile with your permission when an insured loss 
occurs, we will pay for the resulting claim.  We will also forego our right to recover the money 
from that person.  However, we will keep the right to recover payment:   if the person has the automobile in connection with the business of selling, repairing, 
maintaining, storing, servicing or parking automobiles; or   if the person using the automobile violates any condition of this policy, or operates it in 
circumstances referred to in 7.2.2.  Examples  1. 
You allow a friend to use your car and she runs into a fire hydrant and 
damages the car.  We will pay for repairs and will not sue her to recover 
the money.  2. 
You hand over your car to a parking attendant or garage employee. He 
scratches the side while parking it. We will pay for repairs and recover 
from the garage owners because they had your automobile in connection 
with their business.  3. 
You allow a friend to use your car. Later, without your knowledge, he 
drives it while impaired by alcohol and hits a tree.  We will pay for the 
repairs to the car, but we will recover from your friend.  Driving while 
impaired is illegal and a violation of the terms of this policy.  7.4.3 Temporary Substitute Automobile Covered  If you or anyone else drives a temporary substitute automobile (described in Section 2), you 
may be responsible for any damage to it as a result of liability imposed by law or agreed to by 
you or the driver.  In that case, we will pay for direct damage for which you or the driver are 
legally responsible, minus the deductible for that peril under this policy.  However, if the owner of the substitute automobile has it insured for such losses, and the 
deductible on that policy is larger than the one on your own policy for such loss, the most we 
will pay will be the difference between the two deductibles.  If there is a disagreement over who is responsible for the damage, we have the right just as we 
would under Section 3 - Liability Coverage, to settle the matter appropriately and we will 
cover the costs of any investigation, negotiation or lawsuit.

Example #1 
You rent a car to replace your own, which is being repaired following an 
accident. While driving the rental car, you cause $800 worth of damage to it. 
The rental company has a collision policy with a $1,000 deductible. The 
Collision deductible in your policy is only $500. In settling the matter, we will 
pay $300 ($800 less $500).  Example #2  You rent a car to replace your own, which is being repaired following an 
accident. While driving the rental car, you cause $2,800 worth of damage to it. 
The rental company has a collision policy with a $1,000 deductible. The 
Collision deductible in your policy is only $500. In settling the matter, we will 
pay $500, the difference between the deductibles.  7.4.4 Loss of Use Due to Theft  If a described automobile is stolen, and you are protected by the All Perils, Comprehensive, or 
Specified Perils options, we will pay reasonable expenses for the rental of a similar substitute 
automobile.  If you choose not to rent an automobile, we will pay reasonable expenses incurred for taxis or 
public transportation.  We won’t cover these costs until 72 hours after the theft has been reported to us or to the 
police. Even if your policy expires after the theft, coverage will continue until your automobile 
is repaired or replaced, or sooner if money is offered to settle the claim.   The most we will pay in either case for such expenses is $900.   
7.5 
Your and Other Insured Persons' Responsibilities  When making a claim under this Section, you and other insured persons must:   notify us in writing within seven days of the incident (or, if unable because of 
incapacity, as soon as possible after that), giving us the best information available at 
that time concerning the loss or damage and circumstances.   do as much as is reasonably possible to protect the automobile from further damage.  
We will pay for any reasonable protection provided.  Further damage resulting from 
failure to provide reasonable protection will not be covered by this policy.

 make no repairs beyond those needed for protection of the automobile, or remove 
evidence of the damage, without our written consent or until we have had time to 
inspect the automobile.   allow us to copy all documents in your or other insured persons' possession that relate 
to the incident.   permit us to inspect the automobile at any reasonable time.   complete a statutory declaration within 90 days of the incident, if requested. The 
declaration will describe what happened in detail, the cause and amount of the loss, 
those affected and how, and state that the loss was truly accidental. We will also need 
to know if any other insurance is involved.   not leave us to dispose of the automobile unless we agree to accept it.  If we decide to 
replace the automobile or pay its actual cash value, less the deductible shown in your 
Certificate of Automobile Insurance, we own the salvage.  7.6 
Our Right to Repair, Replace or Rebuild the Automobile  We have the right to repair, replace or rebuild the automobile rather than pay for the damage.  If we 
choose to do this, we will let you or other insured persons know in writing within seven days of 
receiving notice of the claim.  We will complete the work within a reasonable time using parts of 
similar kind and quality.  7.7 
What We Will Pay  We will not pay more for the automobile than its actual cash value at the time it was damaged or 
stolen, less the deductible shown in your Certificate of Automobile Insurance.  The value of the loss or damage is also based on actual cash value after taking into account 
depreciation. We will not pay more to repair the automobile than its actual cash value at the time it 
was damaged or stolen, less the deductible.  We will pay the lower of the following:   the cost to repair the loss or damage, less the deductible; or 
 the actual cash value of the automobile at the time it was damaged or stolen, less the 
deductible.  Example  When your automobile was new, three years ago, it cost $16,000.  Today, its 
actual cash value is $10,000. You have the optional Comprehensive Coverage 
and your deductible is $500. If the automobile were totally destroyed in a fire or

the automobile were stolen, the most we would pay under the optional coverage 
is $9,500 ($10,000 - $500).  We will not pay more than $1,500 for loss or damage to electronic accessories or equipment other 
than factory installed equipment. We will pay the actual cash value of the equipment up to $1,500 in 
total.  “Electronic accessories and equipment” includes, but is not limited to, radios, tape players/decks,

Settling a Claim  If you disagree with us over the value of the vehicle or equipment or the nature or the amount or costs 
of any repairs or the amount we should pay, the issue can be submitted for an appraisal under the 
Insurance Act, if you ask for it, or if we ask for it and you agree. You and we will each appoint an 
appraiser, who will either agree on the award or, if they disagree, will appoint an umpire to decide as 
between their respective positions.
