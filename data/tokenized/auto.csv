7thEditionPolicy,2,0," Introduction   1    This insurance policy is a legal contract between the policy-owner (you) and the company (we or us).  It insures you and your auto for the period shown on the Coverage Selections Page. As long as you pay your premium, we agree to provide you or others the benefits to which you or they are entitled.  The exact terms and conditions are explained in the following pages. There are two basic categories of insurance described in this policy, Compulsory Insurance and Optional Insurance.    Compulsory There are four Parts to Compulsory Insurance.  They are all re- Insurance quired by law.  Every auto registered in Massachusetts must have them.    Optional There are eight Parts to Optional Insurance.  Some of them extend Insurance the coverage or the amounts of protection provided by Compulsory Insurance.  Some of them provide protection not found in Compulsory Insurance.  You do not have to buy any of these eight Parts if you do not want to.    Auto insurance claims arise in hundreds of different ways.  Autos are sometimes stolen or damaged.  Accidents may injure people in your auto, people in other autos or pedestrians.  You may be responsible for an accident or someone else may be.  An accident may happen in Massachusetts or out of state.  Different situations require different kinds of insurance. Please read the whole policy to see what kinds of insurance are available to cover these different situations.  At the same time, you should check the Coverage Selections Page to make sure it correctly indicates the coverages you purchased.  Each coverage you purchased will show a premium charge next to it.  If no premium charge is shown, you do not have that coverage. Sometimes you and we will agree to change this policy.  The only way that can be done is by an “Endorsement” added to the basic policy form.  All endorsements must be in writing.  They then become part of this policy. We are pleased to have you as a customer and hope you have a safe and accident-free year. But if you need us, we are here to help you.  If you have an accident or loss, or if someone sues you, contact your agent or us. Do the same if you have any questions or complaints.  If you think we have treated you unfairly at any time, you may contact the Division of Insurance, (617) 521-7777 ",introduction insurance policy legal contract policy owner company insure auto period show coverage selections page long pay premium agree provide benefit entitle exact term condition explain follow page basic category insurance describe policy compulsory insurance optional insurance compulsory part compulsory insurance insurance quire law auto register massachusetts optional part optional insurance extend insurance coverage amount protection provide compulsory insurance provide protection find compulsory insurance buy part want auto insurance claim arise hundred different way auto steal damage accidents injure people auto people auto pedestrian responsible accident accident happen massachusetts state different situation require different kind insurance read policy kind insurance available cover different situation time check coverage selections page sure correctly indicate coverage purchase coverage purchase premium charge premium charge show coverage agree change policy way endorsement add basic policy form endorsement writing policy pleased customer hope safe accident free year need help accident loss sue contact agent question complaint think treat unfairly time contact division insurance

7thEditionPolicy,5,0," 4 Compulsory Insurance There are four Parts to Compulsory Insurance.  They are called Compulsory Insurance because Massachusetts law requires you to buy all of them before you can register your auto.  No law requires you to buy more than this Compulsory Insurance.  However, if you have financed your auto, the bank or finance company may legally insist that you have some Optional Insurance as a condition of your loan. The amount of your coverage and the cost of each Part is shown on the Coverage Selections Page. Your Compulsory Insurance does not pay for any damage to your auto no matter what happens to it. Part 1. Under this Part, we will pay damages to people injured or killed by Bodily Injury your auto in Massachusetts accidents.  The damages we will pay To Others are the amounts the injured person is entitled to collect for bodily injury through a court judgment or settlement.  We will pay only if you or someone else using your auto with your consent is legally responsible for the accident.  The most we will pay for injuries to one or more persons as a result of bodily injury to any one person in any one accident is $20,000.  Subject to this $20,000 limit, the most we will pay for injuries to two or more people as the result of bodily injury to two or more people in any one accident is $40,000.  This is the most we will pay as the result of a single accident no matter how many autos or premiums are shown on the Coverage Selections Page. We will not pay: 1. For injuries to guest occupants of your auto. 2. For accidents outside of Massachusetts or in places in Massa- chusetts where the public has no right of access. 3. For injuries to any employees of the legally responsible person if they are entitled to Massachusetts workers’ compensation benefits. The law provides a special protection for anyone entitled to damages under this Part.  We must pay their claims even if false statements were made when applying for this policy or your auto registration. We must also pay even if you or the legally responsible person fails to cooperate with us after the accident.  We will, however, be entitled to reimbursement from the person who did not cooperate or who made any false statements. If a claim is covered by us and also by another company authorized to sell auto insurance in Massachusetts, we will pay only our proportionate share.  If someone covered under this Part is using an auto he or she does not own at the time of the accident, the owner’s ",compulsory insurance part compulsory insurance call compulsory insurance massachusetts law require buy register auto law require buy compulsory insurance finance auto bank finance company legally insist optional insurance condition loan coverage cost show coverage selections page compulsory insurance pay damage auto matter happen pay damage people injure kill bodily injury auto massachusetts accident damage pay amount injure person entitle collect bodily injury court judgment settlement pay auto consent legally responsible accident pay injury person result bodily injury person accident subject limit pay injury people result bodily injury people accident pay result single accident matter auto premium show coverage selections page pay injury guest occupant auto accident outside massachusetts place chusett public right access injury employee legally responsible person entitle massachusetts worker compensation benefit law provide special protection entitle damage pay claim false statement apply policy auto registration pay legally responsible person fail cooperate accident entitle reimbursement person cooperate false statement claim cover company authorize sell auto insurance massachusetts pay proportionate share cover auto time accident owner

Then, we will pay, up to the limits shown on your Coverage Selections Page, for any damages not covered by that insurance. Part 2. The benefits under this Part are commonly known as “PIP” or “No-  Personal Injury Fault” benefits. It makes no difference who is legally responsible for Protection the accident. We will pay the benefits described below to you and other people injured or killed in auto accidents. For any one accident, we will pay as many people as are injured, but the most we will pay for injuries to any one person is $8,000.  This is the most we will pay no matter how many autos or premiums are shown on the Coverage Selections Page. We will pay three kinds of benefits: A. Medical Expenses We will pay all reasonable expenses incurred as a result of the accident for necessary medical, surgical, X-ray and dental services.  This includes prosthetic devices. It also includes ambulance, hospital, professional nursing and funeral services. B. Lost Wages If an injured person is out of work because of the accident, we will pay lost wages up to 75% of his or her average weekly gross wage or equivalent for the year ending on the day immediately before the accident.  We will not pay for the loss of any other type of income. If the injured person was unemployed at the time of the accident, we will pay up to 75% of the amount he or she actually lost in earning power as a result of the accident. C. Replacement Services We will reimburse the injured person for reasonable payments made to anyone outside his or her household for necessary services that he or she would have performed without pay for the benefit of the household, had he or she not been injured. We will pay PIP benefits to or for: 1. You, or any other person, if injured while occupying your auto with your consent. 2. You, or anyone living in your household, if injured while occupying an auto which does not have Massachusetts Compulsory Insurance or if struck by an auto which does not have Massachusetts Compulsory Insurance 3.

7thEditionPolicy,7,0," 6    Compulsory Insurance (Continued) Massachusetts or any Massachusetts resident who, while a pedestrian, is struck by your auto outside of Massachusetts. Benefits are paid only for expenses or losses actually incurred within two years after the accident. If the accident is in Massachusetts, or if it is outside Massachusetts and the injured person does not sue for damages, we will pay benefits within a reasonable time – usually thirty days.  If the accident is outside Massachusetts and the injured person does sue, then we can wait for a settlement or judgment before paying benefits. Some people have a wage continuation program at work.  If so, we will pay them only the difference between the total we would ordi-narily pay under this Part and the amount of the program payments.  We will, however, reimburse the program if it allows benefits to be converted into cash or additional retirement credit.  Sometimes program benefits are reduced or used up because of payments to the person injured in an accident.  In that case, we will pay for lost wages resulting from any other illness or injury that person has within one year of our last payment.  The exact amount of our payments under this paragraph will be determined by Massachusetts law. Some people have a policy of health, sickness, or disability insur- ance or a contract or agreement with a group, organization part- nership or corporation to provide, pay for, or reimburse the cost of medical expenses (“health plan”).  If so, we will pay up to $2,000 of medical expenses for any injured person.  We will also pay medical expenses in excess of $2,000 for such injured person which will not be paid by a health plan.  Medical expenses must be submitted to the health plan to determine what the health plan will pay before we pay benefits in excess of $2,000 under this Part.  We will not pay for medical expenses in excess of $2,000 that the health plan would have paid had the injured person sought treatment in accordance with the requirements of the health plan.  In any case, our total payment for medical expenses, lost wages and replacement services will not exceed $8,000. Within two years after an accident, we may, at our option, pay the cost of renewing or continuing in force a policy of health, sickness or disability insurance for anyone covered under this Part who is unwilling or unable to pay such cost.  Our payment will not exceed the cost of renewing or continuing such policy for a period of two years after the accident.  Also, our payment will not operate to reduce the benefits otherwise payable under this Part.

7thEditionPolicy,8,0,"     Compulsory    Insurance    (Continued) 7We will not pay PIP benefits to or for: 1. Anyone who, at the time of the accident, was operating or occupying a motorcycle, any motor vehicle not subject to motor vehicle registration, or a motorized bicycle, including a moped. 2. Anyone who contributed to his or her injury by operating an auto (a) while under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, or a narcotic drug, (b) while committing a felony or seeking to avoid arrest by a police officer, or (c) with the specific intent of causing injury to himself, herself or others. 3. Anyone who is entitled to benefits under any workers’ compensation law for the same injury. When you purchased this Part you were given the choice of either excluding yourself, or yourself and household members, from some or all of the PIP coverage.  The portion of each claim you may have agreed not to be covered for is called a “deductible.” You paid a smaller premium if you chose a deductible.  In that case, we will only pay up to the difference between $8,000 and the amount of your deductible.  The deductible is shown on the Coverage Selections Page. If anyone is entitled to PIP benefits and also to benefits under another Part of this policy, we will pay from this Part first. We will not pay PIP benefits to or for an injured person, to the  extent those benefits would duplicate expenses or losses recovered by that person in a court judgment or settlement. If anyone covered under this policy is also entitled to PIP benefits from any other auto policy, the total benefits payable will not be more than the highest amount payable under whichever one of the policies would have paid the most.  In that case, each insurer will pay only its proportionate share.  We will not pay benefits under this Part which duplicate payments made under the No-Fault coverage of any other auto policy. Part 3. Sometimes an owner or operator of an auto legally responsible Bodily Injury for an accident is uninsured.  Some accidents involve unidentified Caused By An hit-and-run autos.  Under this Part, we will pay damages for bodily Uninsured Auto injury to people injured or killed in certain accidents caused by uninsured or hit-and-run autos.  We will pay only if the injured person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of the uninsured or hit-and-run auto.  We will pay for hit-and-run accidents only if the owner or operator causing the accident cannot be identified ",compulsory insurance continued pay pip benefit time accident operate occupy motorcycle motor vehicle subject motor vehicle registration motorized bicycle include moped contribute injury operate auto influence alcohol marijuana narcotic drug b commit felony seek avoid arrest police officer c specific intent cause injury entitle benefit worker compensation law injury purchase give choice exclude household member pip coverage portion claim agree cover call deductible pay small premium choose deductible case pay difference deductible deductible show coverage selections page entitle pip benefit benefit policy pay pay pip benefit injured person extent benefit duplicate expense loss recover person court judgment settlement cover policy entitle pip benefit auto policy total benefit payable high payable whichever policy pay case insurer pay proportionate share pay benefit duplicate payment fault coverage auto policy owner operator auto legally responsible bodily injury accident uninsured accident involve unidentified cause hit run auto pay damage bodily uninsured auto injury people injure kill certain accident cause uninsured hit run auto pay injure person legally entitle recover owner operator uninsured hit run auto pay hit run accident owner operator cause accident identify
7thEditionPolicy,9,0," 8    Compulsory Insurance (Continued) Sometimes the company insuring the auto responsible  for an accident will deny coverage or become insolvent.  We consider such an auto to be uninsured for purposes of this Part.  However, we do not consider an auto owned by a governmental unit or someone who is legally self-insured to be an uninsured auto. This Part is Compulsory.  You must have limits of $20,000 per person and $40,000 per accident.  However, you may want to buy more protection.  If so, we must sell you limits up to $35,000 per person and $80,000 per accident, provided you have purchased at least these limits for Part 5.  Higher limits may be purchased if agreed upon by you and by us. We will pay damages to or for: 1. You, while occupying your auto, while occupying an auto you do not own, or if injured as a pedestrian. 2. Any household member, while occupying your auto, while occupying an auto not owned by you or if injured as a pedestrian.  If there are two or more policies which provide coverage at the     same limits, we will only pay our proportionate share.  We will not pay damages to or for any household member who has a Massachusetts auto policy of his or her own or who is covered by any Massachusetts auto policy of another household member providing uninsured auto insurance with higher limits. 3. Anyone else while occupying your auto.  We will not pay damages to or for anyone else who has a Massachusetts auto  policy of his or her own, or who is covered by any Massachusetts auto policy of another household member providing uninsured  auto insurance. 4. Anyone else for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of injury to a person covered under this Part. If you are injured while occupying your auto and you have two or more autos insured with us with different limits, we will only pay up to the limits shown on your Coverage Selections Page for the auto you are occupying when injured. If you are injured as a pedestrian or while occupying an auto you do not own and you have two or more Massachusetts auto policies which provide coverage at different limits, the policy with the higher limits will pay.  If there are two or more policies which provide coverage at the same limits, we will only pay our proportionate share.

Likewise, we will not pay damages to or for any household member if struck by, or while occupying an auto owned by that household member which does not have Massachusetts compulsory auto insurance. The most we will pay for damages to or for anyone injured in the following situations is $35,000 per person and $80,000 per accident or the limits you purchased, whichever is less: 1. Anyone injured while occupying your auto while it is being used as a public or livery conveyance.  This does not apply to the use of your auto in a share-the-expense car pool arrangement or in an expense reimbursement program either as a volunteer or at work. 2. Anyone injured while using an auto without the consent of the owner. 3. Anyone injured while an auto is being operated in any prearranged or organized racing, speed, stunting or demolition contest or activity or in practice or preparation for any such contest or activity.    We will reduce the damages an injured person is entitled to recover by: 1. The amount recovered from any legally responsible person provided the injured person is fully compensated for his or her damages for bodily injury. 2. The amount paid under a workers’ compensation law or similar law. 3. Any expenses that are payable or would have been payable, except for a deductible, under the PIP coverage of this policy or any other Massachusetts auto policy. We will pay the balance of the damages up to the limits shown for this Part on your Coverage Selections Page. The determination as to whether an injured person is legally entitled to recover damages from the legally responsible owner or operator will be by agreement between us and the injured person.  The amount of the damages, if any, will be determined in the same way.  Arbitration will be used if no agreement can be reached.  However, in no event may a demand for arbitration constitute first notice of claim.  We must be given sufficient notice of claim to conduct a reasonable investigation and attempt settlement before arbitration can be filed ",compulsory insurance continued auto massachusetts compulsory auto insurance likewise pay damage household member strike occupy auto own household member massachusetts compulsory auto insurance pay damage injure follow situation person accident limit purchase whichever injure occupy auto public livery conveyance apply use auto share expense car pool arrangement expense reimbursement program volunteer work injure auto consent owner injure auto operate prearranged organized racing speed stunting demolition contest activity practice preparation contest activity reduce damage injure person entitle recover recover legally responsible person provide injure person fully compensate damage bodily injury pay worker compensation law similar law expense payable payable deductible pip coverage policy massachusetts auto policy pay balance damage limit show coverage selections page determination injure person legally entitle recover damage legally responsible owner operator agreement injure person damage determine way arbitration agreement reach event demand arbitration constitute notice claim give sufficient notice claim conduct reasonable investigation attempt settlement arbitration file
7thEditionPolicy,11,0," 10    Compulsory Insurance (Continued) If an injured person settles a claim as a result of an accident covered under this Part, we will pay that person only if the claim was settled with our consent.  We will not be bound under this Part by any judgment resulting from a lawsuit brought without our written consent.  We will not, however, unreasonably withhold our consent. The most we will pay for injuries to one or more persons as a result of bodily injury to any one person in any one accident is shown on the Coverage Selections Page as the “per person” limit.  Subject to this limit, the most we will pay for injuries to two or more people as the result of bodily injury to two or more people in any one accident is shown on the Coverage Selections Page as the “per accident” limit.  This is the most we will pay as the result of a single accident. The limits of two or more autos or policies shall not be added to- gether, combined, or stacked, to determine the limits of coverage available to anyone covered under this Part, regardless of the number of autos involved, persons covered, claims made, or premiums shown on the Coverage Selections Page. We will not make payments under this Part which duplicate payments under the uninsured auto insurance of any other auto policy. The Part will not benefit any insurer or self-insurer under a workers’ compensation law or any similar law. Part 4.

Then, we will pay for any damages not paid by that insurance, up to the policy limit shown on the Coverage Selections Page.  However, if the claim is covered by us and another auto policy, we will pay only our proportionate share of those damages not paid by the owner’s auto insurance. Under this Part, we may have to pay for property damage even if you or the legally responsible person fails to give us prompt notice of the accident.

7thEditionPolicy,13,0," 12 Optional Insurance There are eight separate Parts to Optional Insurance.  They are called Optional Insurance because they are not required by law.  The amount of insurance and cost of any of these Parts you purchased is shown on the Coverage Selections Page. With the exception of Towing and Labor (Part 11), we must sell you any or all of the Optional coverages you wish, subject to certain deductibles and limits specified in Massachusetts law.  However, Massachusetts law provides that we may refuse to sell Collision (Part 7) and Comprehensive (Part 9), or both, in certain specified instances. Because two of the Optional coverages – Collision (Part 7) and Limited Collision (Part 8) – duplicate each other in many ways, you may buy one of them but not both. If you do not buy either one, you still have the right to sue people who damage your auto but we will not provide any assistance to you under this policy. We will not pay under any of the Optional coverages: 1. If the accident happens while your auto is being used as a public or livery conveyance.  This does not apply to the use of your auto in a share-the-expense car pool arrangement or in an expense reimbursement program either as a volunteer or at work. 2. For loss of any items used in the reproduction of sound, unless they have been permanently installed in the auto.  However, we will pay for the loss of any such item if it operates in the auto exclusively and only when used in combination with the components permanently installed in the auto. Tapes, discs, and records are not covered. 3. For loss of or damage to a citizens band radio, two-way mobile radio, telephone or scanning monitor receiver, including their related equipment.  We will pay, however, for such loss or damage if this equipment is permanently installed in the opening of the dash or console normally used by the auto manufacturer for the installation of a radio or a telephone. 4. For loss of or damage to any custom furnishings or custom equipment in or upon any pick-up truck, van or similar vehicle.  Custom furnishings or custom equipment include but are not limited to the following items: special carpeting and insulation, furniture, bars, television receivers, facilities for cooking and sleeping, height-extending roofs, custom murals, paintings or other decals or graphics. 5. For loss or damage to equipment designed for the detection or avoidance of any law enforcement speed measuring device.

Part 5. Under this Part, we will pay damages to people injured or killed in Optional Bodily accidents if you or a household member is legally responsible for Injury to Others the accident. We will also pay damages if someone else using your    auto with your consent is legally responsible for the accident.  The damages we will pay are the amounts the injured person is entitled to collect for bodily injury through a court judgment or settlement. This Part is similar to Compulsory Bodily Injury To Others (Part 1). Like the Compulsory Part, this Part pays for accidents involving your auto in Massachusetts.  Also like the Compulsory Part, this Part does not pay for the benefit of anyone using an auto without the consent of the owner. Unlike the Compulsory Part, this Part does provide coverage for injuries to guest occupants and for accidents occurring outside Massachusetts. In addition, we will not pay: 1. For injuries to employees of the person using the auto who are injured in the course of employment. 2. For injuries resulting from an accident while a household member, other than your spouse, is using an auto which you or any household member owns or uses regularly, unless a premium for this Part is shown for that auto on the Coverage Selections Page. 3. For injuries resulting from an accident while you or your spouse, if a household member, are using an auto which you or your spouse, if a household member, own or use regularly unless a premium for this Part is shown for that auto on the Coverage Selections Page. 4. While any auto is being used by anyone in the course of his or her employment in the business of selling, servicing, repairing, or parking autos.  This exclusion does not apply to the ownership, maintenance or use of your auto by you or a household member. 5.

This exclusion does not apply to private passenger autos, or to pick-up trucks, vans, or similar vehicles having a gross vehicle weight of less than 10,000 pounds and not used for the delivery or transportation of goods or materials unless such use is incidental to your business of installing, maintaining, or repairing furnishings or equipment ",optional insurance continued injury damage intentionally cause household member auto consent pay damage people injure kill optional bodily accident household member legally responsible injury accident pay damage auto consent legally responsible accident damage pay amount injure person entitle collect bodily injury court judgment settlement similar compulsory bodily injury like compulsory pay accident involve auto massachusetts like compulsory pay benefit auto consent owner unlike compulsory provide coverage injury guest occupant accident occur outside massachusetts addition pay injury employee person auto injure course employment injury result accident household member spouse auto household member own use regularly premium show auto coverage selections page injury result accident spouse household member auto spouse household member use regularly premium show auto coverage selections page auto course employment business selling servicing repair parking auto exclusion apply ownership maintenance use auto household member vehicle course business business selling servicing repair parking auto exclusion apply private passenger auto pick truck van similar vehicle have gross vehicle weight pound delivery transportation good material use incidental business instal maintaining repair furnishing equipment
7thEditionPolicy,15,0," 14    Optional Insurance (Continued) If the accident occurs in any other state or in a Canadian province and you have purchased any coverage at all under this Part, your policy will automatically apply to that accident as follows: If the state or province has: 1. A financial responsibility law or similar law specifying limits of liability for bodily injury or property damage higher than the limits you have purchased, your policy will provide the higher specified limits. 2. A compulsory insurance or similar law requiring your auto to have insurance whenever it is used in the state or province, your policy will provide at least the required minimum amounts and types of coverage. The limits shown for this Part on the Coverage Selections Page are the total limits you have under Compulsory Bodily Injury to Others (Part 1) and this Part.  This means that the Compulsory limits are included within the limits shown on the Coverage Selections Page for this Part and are not in addition to them. The most we will pay for injuries to one or more persons as a result of bodily injury to any one person in any one accident is shown on the Coverage Selections Page as the “per person” limit for the auto involved in that accident.  Subject to this limit, the most we will pay for injuries to two or more people as the result of bodily injury to two or more people in any one accident is shown on the Coverage Selections Page as the “per accident” limit for the auto involved in that accident.  This is the most we will pay as the result of a single accident no matter how many autos or premiums are shown on the Coverage Selections Page. If someone covered under this Part is using an auto he or she does not own at the time of the accident, the owner’s auto insurance must pay its limits before we pay.  Then, we will pay for any damages not paid by that insurance, up to the policy limits shown on your Coverage Selections Page.  However, if the claim is covered by us and another auto policy, we will pay only our proportionate share of those damages not paid by the owner’s auto insurance. Any payments we make to anyone or for anyone under Bodily Injury Caused By An Uninsured Auto (Part 3) will reduce the amount of damages that person is entitled to recover from anyone covered under this Part. We will also pay up to $250 for the cost of bail bonds required as a result of an accident covered under this Part including bail bonds for traffic law violations related to the accident.

Anyone injured in the course of employment in selling, servicing, repairing or parking autos if that person is entitled to workers’ compensation benefits. 3.

This is the most we will pay as the result of a single accident no matter how many autos or premiums are shown on the Coverage Selections Page.  If someone covered under this Part is also entitled to Medical Payments coverage under another auto policy issued to you or any household member, we will pay only our proportionate share. If someone covered under this Part is using an auto he or she does not own at the time of the accident, the owner’s automobile Medical Payments insurance must pay its limit before we pay. Then, we will pay up to the limit shown on your Coverage Selections Page for any expenses not covered by that insurance. We will not pay benefits under this Part which duplicate payments made under the Medical Payments coverage of any other auto policy.

The amount paid under a workers’ compensation law or similar law. 4.   Any expenses that are payable or would have been payable, except for a deductible, under the PIP coverage of this policy or any other Massachusetts auto policy. If only one person sustains bodily injury, we will pay any unpaid damages up to the difference between the total amount collected from the automobile bodily injury liability insurance covering the legally responsible owners and operators of all insured autos and the “per person” limit shown for this Part on your Coverage Selections Page.  This is the most we will pay for injuries to one or more persons as the result of bodily injury to any one person in any one accident. Subject to the “per person” limit, if two or more people sustain bodily injury and are entitled to coverage under this Part, we will pay any unpaid damages up to the difference between the automobile bodily injury liability insurance “per accident” limit covering the legally responsible owners and operators and the “per accident” limit shown for this Part on your Coverage Selections Page.  This is the most we will pay for injuries to two or more people as the result of bodily injury to two or more people in any one accident. The determination as to whether an injured person is legally entitled to recover damages from the legally responsible owner or operator will be by agreement between us and the injured person.  The amount of damages, if any, will be determined in the same way.  Arbitration will be used if no agreement can be reached.  However, in no event may a demand for arbitration constitute first notice of claim.  We must be given sufficient notice of claim to conduct a reasonable investigation and attempt settlement before arbitration can be filed. If an injured person settles a claim as a result of an accident covered under this Part, we will pay that person only if the claim was settled with our consent.  We will not be bound under this Part by any judgment resulting from a lawsuit brought without our written consent. We will not, however, unreasonably withhold our consent. The limits of two or more autos or policies shall not be added together, combined or stacked, to determine the limits of coverage available to anyone covered under this Part, regardless of the number of autos involved, persons covered, claims made, or premiums shown on the Coverage Selections Page. We will not make payments under this Part which duplicate payments under the underinsured auto insurance of any other auto policy.

Our Right Sometimes we may make a payment under this policy to you or to To Be Repaid someone else who has a separate legal right to recover damages from others. In that case, those legal rights may be exercised by us.  Anyone receiving payment under those circumstances must do nothing to interfere with those rights.  He or she must also do what- ever is necessary to help us recover for ourselves up to the amount we have paid.  If we then recover more than we paid, we will pay that person the excess, less his or her proportionate share of the costs of recovery, including reasonable attorney’s fees. Any amount recovered, because of a payment we make under Part 3 or Part 12 of this policy, shall first be applied to any unpaid damages due that person.  Such unpaid damages must be a part of a claim settled with our consent or a part of a judgment resulting from a lawsuit brought with our written consent. Any balance then remaining shall be applied to the amounts we have paid under Part 3 or Part 12.  We will reduce the amount we will pay that person by his or her proportionate share of the costs of recovery including reasonable attorney’s fees. Sometimes you or someone else may recover money from the person legally responsible for an accident and also receive money from us for the same accident.  If so, the amount we paid must be repaid to us to the extent that you or someone else recovers. If you or someone else recover money from the person legally respon- sible for the accident and also receive money from us for the same accident as a payment under Part 3 or Part 12 of this policy, we must be repaid for any amounts so paid but only to the extent that such recovery exceeds any unpaid damages due that person under a claim settled with our consent or judgment resulting from a law- suit brought with our written consent. Whenever we are entitled to repayment from anyone, the amount owed us can be reduced by our proportionate share of the costs of recovering the money, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. In either case we do not have to be repaid for any money we have paid under Medical Payments (Part 6).

1215E.2,5,0," vi    What Insurance is Required by Law    If you own an automobile that is operated on a highway in Ontario, certain insurance coverages are required by law. You may also choose to buy additional insurance to extend these coverages to protect against other risks. The chart below is only a general summary to give you an idea of the insurance coverages available to you. For details of each coverage and the conditions that apply, you should consult the appropriate sections of the policy. If there is a difference between the information in this chart and the appropriate section of the policy, the section of the policy prevails.    You only have a specific coverage if your Certificate of Automobile Insurance shows a premium for it or it is provided at no cost. If you have insured more than one automobile, a premium must be shown for each automobile.    Insurance Required by Law Type of Coverage What the Coverage Does Policy  Section Liability Protects you if someone else is killed or injured or their property is damaged.  It will pay for legitimate claims against you up to the limit of your coverage, and will pay the costs of settling the claims.

These benefits may include:     supplementary medical care, rehabilitation and attendant care;  a tax-free income benefit for wage earners or self-employed;  an allowance to those who have no income from employment;   an allowance when a caregiver is injured; and  funeral expenses and death benefits when a person dies in an accident.

The contract includes three documents:  a completed and signed Application for Automobile Insurance,  a Certificate of Automobile Insurance, and  this policy. Under the contract, we agree to provide you with the insurance that is summarized on your Certificate of Automobile Insurance, and for which you have agreed to pay a premium.    You only have a particular coverage for a specific automobile if your Certificate of Automobile Insurance shows a premium for it or shows the coverage is provided at no cost.    1.2  Where You Are Covered     This policy covers you and other insured persons for incidents occurring in Canada, the United States of America and any other jurisdiction designated in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule, and on a vessel travelling between ports of those countries. All of the dollar limits described in this policy are in Canadian funds. 1.3  Definitions    Automobile In this policy, motorized snow vehicle is included in the definition of automobile. Regulations may include, or exclude, certain other types or classes of vehicles as automobiles. In this policy, there is a difference between a described automobile and the automobile.

These types of automobiles are described more fully in Section 2.    Certificate of Automobile Insurance A Certificate of Automobile Insurance is a written document summarizing your insurance coverage. It shows your name and/or organization, and the described automobile or automobiles.  It lists the coverages purchased, premiums charged, and the period during which the insurance is in effect. Covered/Coverage When we talk of someone or something being covered, we mean that they are protected by insurance. When we speak of coverage, we are describing what types of protection they have and how much for each type. Direct Loss or Damage Direct loss or damage refers to damage or loss caused directly by a peril.  This is different than an indirect loss.

Some claims for Accident Benefits will be paid sooner. If we refuse to pay a claim, we will notify the insured person in writing explaining the reasons why we are not liable to pay.    1.6.2 If You Have Been Incorrectly Classified and Your Premium is Wrong    We use rules that determine the amount you pay for each coverage and category of automobile insurance.

If the incorrect classification resulted in your paying too high a premium, we will refund any premium overpayment with interest.  The interest will cover the period for which you were overcharged.    The rate of interest will be the bank rate, as set by the Bank of Canada, on the first day of the last month of the quarter preceding the quarter in which you were incorrectly classified. If the bank rate includes a fraction we will round it off to the next highest number.  (The bank rate is the rate at which the Bank of Canada makes short-term loans to chartered banks.)

If you cancel, we will calculate the premium you owe on a short rate basis. Short rate means that the premium you owe will include our handling costs.  We will refund anything due to you as soon as possible.    There may be a minimum premium set out in your Certificate of Automobile Insurance. This will not be refunded.    1.7.2 When We Cancel    Where your policy has been in effect for up to 60 days, we may only cancel your policy for a reason that we have filed with the Financial Services Commission of Ontario.    Where your policy has been in effect for more than 60 days, we may only cancel your policy for one of the following reasons:     non-payment of premium,  you have given false particulars of the automobile to our prejudice,  you have knowingly misrepresented or failed to disclose information that you were required to provide in the application for automobile insurance, or  the risk has changed materially.    If we cancel your policy, we will calculate the premium you owe on a proportionate basis. Proportionate means you will pay for the actual number of days you were covered. For example, if half the premium period is over, you will pay half the premium.    There may be a minimum premium shown on your Certificate of Automobile Insurance. This will not be refunded.    If you have paid more than the premium you owe, we will refund the difference on cancellation. Your refund may be delayed if the amount of premium you owe is subject to adjustment, or we are waiting for reports in order to determine the premium paid or owing.

However, in the case of an incident involving an automobile you don't own, we will only pay up to the highest limit that applies to any one automobile described in this policy.    Example    Your automobile policy has Liability Coverage on two automobiles for $300,000 and $500,000 respectively. If you are driving someone else's automobile and are involved in an accident, the most we would pay is $500,000.    2.3.2 Under More Than One Policy    When you have two or more automobiles insured as described automobiles under two or more policies, each automobile will be covered by its respective policy.    However, determining how much we will pay is more complicated if there is an incident in an automobile you don't own.    The amount we will pay under this policy for any incident will be a fraction of the highest policy limit.  This fraction will be the proportion that the limit under this policy bears to the total of the limits of all the policies.    In no case will we pay more than this proportion of the highest limit.

If you have an accident while driving an automobile you don't own, here is how we will calculate the amount we will pay.    Step 1. What is the total of the limits of all the policies?     200,000 (limit under Policy A) + 300,000 (limit under Policy B)    500,000 (total under both policies)    Step 2. What is the proportion of the limit under Policy A to the total from Step 1?     200,000 (limit under Policy A) = 2    500,000 (total under both policies)    5    Step 3. What is the most we will pay under this policy?     2 x 300,000 (highest policy limit)  =  120,000    5    The most we would pay would be 2/5 of the loss, but never more than $120,000, 2/5 of the highest policy limit.  The other policy will pay the remaining 3/5 of the loss to a maximum of $180,000.    2.4    Trailers and Towing    2.4.1 Trailers    An automobile pulling one or more trailers will be treated as a single automobile when determining how much we will pay under Liability, Accident Benefits and Uninsured Automobile Coverages. However, they will be treated as separate automobiles when determining the deductibles and how much we will pay under Direct Compensation - Property Damage and optional Loss or Damage Coverages.    2.4.2 Automobiles in Tow    We may inspect the automobile at any reasonable time.  If you do not co-operate in any incident involving two or more automobiles owned by different persons and attached to each other, the insurer of each automobile will compensate its insured for losses according to the terms of the Direct Compensation - Property Damage and optional Loss or Damage coverages.

We will consider these other people insured persons.    Your Liability Coverage applies when you or others use or operate certain other types of automobiles. See Section 2 for details and additional conditions.    3.3 What We Cover    You or other insured persons may be legally responsible for the bodily injury to, or death of others, or for damage to the property of others as a result of owning, leasing or operating the automobile or renting or leasing another automobile.  In these cases, we will make any payment on your or other insured persons' behalf that the law requires, up to the limits of the policy.    We will also reimburse anyone covered by this policy for costs involved in providing immediate medical aid needed by someone hurt in an automobile incident.

We will pay all legal costs the court assesses against you and other insured persons in the lawsuit we have defended.    If there is a judgment against you or other insured persons, we will pay any post-judgment interest owed on that part of the amount the court orders that falls within the liability limits of your policy.

We will cover the $10,000 in costs, and $500,000 of the judgment.  We will also pay any interest owed on that amount from the day of the judgment.

We also agree not to use any legal defence that would not be available if the policy had been issued in that jurisdiction.    Example    You have an accident in a province where the minimum liability coverage required is $500,000.

In such cases, we will act as if a separate policy was issued to each named insured.  However, the total amount we will pay (over and above legal costs and post-judgment interest) cannot exceed the maximum coverage shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance.    Example    Two people are in business together. Both are named in the insurance policy covering their van. They have bought Liability Coverage of $500,000.    One day, there is an accident while one is driving and the other is a passenger. Both of them are severely injured as a result of their combined negligence.    They sue each other and one is awarded $300,000 and the other $500,000. The combined amount we will pay will not be more than the policy limit of $500,000 plus legal costs and post-judgment interest.    3.3.5 Rented and Leased Automobiles    For convenience in this subsection we use the terms rent, renter and rented as equivalent to lease, lessee and leased.

The following rules govern the order in which the policies will respond:    1. If insurance is available to the person who rented the automobile, the policy providing that insurance responds first. 2. If insurance is available to the driver of the rented automobile, the policy providing that insurance responds next. 3. If insurance is available to the owner of the rented automobile, the policy providing that insurance responds last.    We have no liability for such claims in excess of the limit of liability coverage specified in the Certificate of Automobile Insurance and do not have the responsibility to defend such claims against anyone other than you, your spouse who lives with you, or the persons mentioned in subsections 2.2.3 (6) and 2.2.4 (6).    Example #1*    You rent a car and your friend is driving it when an accident occurs in Ontario. You, your friend, and the rental company may face claims by other people who have sustained a loss in the accident. If insurance is available to you under your policy for such claims and your friend was at fault for the accident, then your policy would be first in line to pay those people. If that coverage were used up, and if insurance is available to your friend under his or her policy, your friend’s insurer would pay next. If that coverage were used up, any insurance available under the rental company’s policy would then pay. None of the insurers has to pay more than the limit of coverage that it agreed to provide.    Example #2*    Your friend rents a car and you are driving it when an accident occurs in Ontario. You, your friend, and the rental company may face claims by other people who have sustained a loss in the accident. If you were at fault for the accident and insurance is available to your friend under his or her policy for such claims, then your friend’s insurer would be first in line to pay those people.

If we choose to do this, we will let you or other insured persons know in writing within seven days of receiving notice of the claim.  We will complete the work within a reasonable time using parts of similar kind and quality.    5.4.4 How Much We Will Pay    The most we will pay for the automobile is its actual cash value at the time it was damaged, less the deductible specified in your Certificate of Automobile Insurance.    The value of the loss or damage is based on actual cash value after taking into account depreciation. We will not pay more to repair the automobile than its actual cash value at the time it was damaged, less the deductible specified in your Certificate of Automobile Insurance.    We will pay the lower of the following:     the cost to repair the loss or damage, less the deductible; or  the actual cash value of the automobile at the time it was damaged, less the applicable deductible.    Example    Your car is four years old and is hit on the front left side by an identified but uninsured automobile.  The damaged part of the body of your car is repaired. We will pay the cost of the repairs, less the $300 deductible, including new paint for the damaged part of your automobile.  If you want the entire car repainted, you will have to pay the cost of painting the rest of the car.    5.5 Claims for Both Bodily Injury and Property Damage    An accident may result in a valid claim for both bodily injury or death and for damage to the automobile or its contents.  In that case, payments for bodily injury and death have priority on 95% of the total amount payable.  Payment for damage to the automobile or contents will have priority on 5%.    Example    An accident in Ontario for which an identified but uninsured driver is responsible destroys your $20,000 car, and results in injuries to you and your spouse, totalling $350,000.    We will not pay more than the minimum liability limit of $200,000. Of that money, 95%, or $190,000, will go toward payment for bodily injury.

The arbitrator will be an individual acceptable to us and you or other insured persons. If both sides can't agree on an arbitrator, then each side will name an arbitrator.  The two arbitrators will then appoint a third. A decision supported by at least two of the three will be binding. All arbitrations will be governed by the Arbitration Act, 1991 (Ontario).    5.6.3 In Court    The matter may be decided in a lawsuit brought against us by you or other insured persons in an Ontario court. If so, we have the right to ask the court to decide who is legally responsible and the amount of compensation owing, unless another Ontario court has already done so in an action that was defended.    5.7 Limitations and Exceptions    5.7.1 Payment Limits    1. We will not pay more than the minimum limits for automobile liability insurance in the jurisdiction in which the accident happens. This amount applies regardless of the number of persons injured or killed, or the damage to the automobile and contents.  In no event will we pay more than the minimum liability limits required in Ontario.    Example    You are travelling in a car outside Ontario when you are injured in an accident for which an uninsured driver is responsible. The minimum liability limit in that jurisdiction is $100,000.

The coverage under this Section applies only if the accident takes place in Ontario and at least one other automobile involved is insured under a motor vehicle liability policy.  The policy covering the other automobile must be issued by an insurance company licensed in Ontario, or one that has filed with the Financial Services Commission of Ontario to provide this coverage.    It is called direct compensation because you will collect from us, your insurance company, even though you, or anyone else using or operating the automobile with your consent, were not entirely at fault for the accident.     6.2 What We Will Cover    We will pay the cost of damage to the automobile, its equipment, contents and for loss of use of the automobile or contents arising from an accident for which another person would have been legally responsible in the absence of section 263 of the Insurance Act (Ontario).  Section 263 takes away your right to sue the other person for these losses.  We will pay no more to repair or replace the automobile or property than its actual cash value at the time it was damaged, less the applicable percentage of the deductible shown on your Certificate of Automobile Insurance.    If a part needed to repair the automobile is no longer available, we will pay an amount equal to the manufacturer's latest list price for the part.

That car is described in your friend's motor vehicle liability policy.  You have an accident for which you are not at fault.     Your friend will claim under the direct compensation property damage provisions of his or her motor vehicle liability policy for the loss.    We will not pay for damage to, or loss of use of, contents that are being carried for reward.    6.3 Who is Covered    In a claim for damage to the automobile, the owner of the automobile is covered for damage.    In a claim for damage to the contents of the automobile, the owner of the contents is covered for damage.    6.4 How Much We Will Pay    6.4.1 Determining Fault    The amount we pay under this Section of your policy will be determined by the degree to which you or the driver were not at fault in the accident.    Responsibility for an accident is determined by the Insurance Act (Ontario) and the Fault Determination Rules. These may find you or the driver wholly or partially responsible.    The degree of responsibility is expressed as a percentage.    6.4.2 The Deductible    The amount we pay may be subject to a Direct Compensation - Property Damage deductible. The deductible is the amount you agree to pay toward the cost of any single claim you make under this Section.  The deductible, if any, is the amount shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance, multiplied by the percentage to which you or the driver of the automobile were not at fault for the accident.  You are not permitted to sue anyone (for instance the at-fault motorist) to recover this deductible.    If you have damage to both your automobile and its contents, the deductible will first be applied to your automobile loss.  If there is any remaining deductible, the remainder will be applied to the contents loss.    You will need to make a separate claim for each accident that causes damage.  The deductible applies each time you make a claim and separately to each automobile that is insured.

Your car is a total loss.    Your Direct Compensation - Property Damage (DC-PD) deductible is $300. Under DC-PD, we cover the damages (less the deductible) for which the other driver would have otherwise been responsible. You are responsible for the deductible. We will pay $8,775 ($9,000 -- being 75% of the value of your automobile -- less $225 -- being 75% of the deductible).    In sum: You receive $8,775. You are responsible for $225 (the DC-PD deductible), and will have to pay the remainder out of your own pocket.  In this example, you will be out-of-pocket for a total of $3,225.

Your Direct Compensation - Property Damage (DC-PD) deductible is $300. We will pay $0 ($250 less $250) toward your car damage, and $75 ($125 less $50) for the contents to the owner of the contents.    In sum: The owner of the contents receives $75.

We will also need to know if any other insurance is involved.     not leave us to dispose of the automobile unless we agree to accept it.  If we decide to replace the automobile or pay its actual cash value, less the applicable deductible, we own the salvage.    6.6 Our Right to Repair, Replace or Rebuild the Automobile    We have the right to repair, replace or rebuild the automobile rather than pay for the damage.  If we choose to do this, we will let you or other insured persons know in writing within seven days of receiving notice of the claim.  We will complete the work within a reasonable time using parts of similar kind and quality.    6.7 Other Limitations on Your Coverage    6.7.1 Contamination of Property    Under this Section, we won't cover claims arising from contamination of property carried in the automobile.    6.7.2 Nuclear Hazards    Nuclear energy hazards means radioactive, toxic, explosive or other hazardous properties of substances described in Regulations made under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (Canada).

We will only pay after the limits of that policy have been paid out.    6.7.3 Settling a Claim    If you disagree with the degree of fault attributed to you under the Fault Determination Rules or with the amount of any proposed settlement, you can bring a law suit against us to have the matter determined by a judge.    Alternatively, if the disagreement is over the value of the vehicle or its contents or the nature, amount or cost of any repairs or the amount we should pay, the matter can be settled by an appraisal under the Insurance Act, if you ask for it or if we ask for it and you agree.

We also won't pay under these coverages for loss or damage caused when an employee of yours steals the automobile and the employee's duties include driving, maintaining or repairing the automobile.  This applies at any time, and not simply during working hours.    7.3 The Deductible    The amount we pay to cover any losses may be subject to a deductible.  The deductible is the amount you agree to pay toward the cost of any single claim you make under this Section.  The deductible, if any, is shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance.    You will need to make a separate claim for each incident that causes loss or damage.  The deductible applies each time you make a claim and separately to each automobile that is insured.    We will only pay for loss or damage that exceeds the amount of the deductible.  If your claim is one to which Section 6, Direct Compensation - Property Damage (DC-PD) Coverage also applies, the amount we will pay under this Section will not include the DC-PD deductible that applies to the claim. Your deductible under this Section will be the Collision deductible multiplied by the percentage to which you or the driver of the automobile were at fault for the accident.    Example #1    You have Comprehensive Coverage, and your deductible is $500. Your car's windshield is broken by a fallen tree. You are responsible for the first $500 of the cost of the windshield replacement. Any claim less than $500 will be your responsibility.

If you are insured for loss or damage caused by fire or lightning, there is no deductible for these losses.    7.4 Additional Benefits    Whatever Loss or Damage Coverage you choose under this Section, your coverage will include the following additional benefits.    7.4.1 Payment of Charges    We will pay general average, salvage and fire department charges and any Canadian or U.S. customs duties for which you are legally responsible as a result of an insured peril.    Example    Your car is damaged in a fire.  The fire department properly bills you for the cost of putting out the fire. A new transmission must be imported before the car can be repaired. We will pay the fire department's bill, import duties on the replacement part and for the parts and repairs themselves.    In this instance, salvage means any expense involved in recovering property to prevent loss from an insured peril.    General average charges may arise when a described automobile is shipped by water. If it becomes necessary to dump a portion of the ship's cargo overboard to save the ship, you may be legally responsible for a share of the resulting losses. We will cover that expense.

We will also forego our right to recover the money from that person.    However, we will keep the right to recover payment:     if the person has the automobile in connection with the business of selling, repairing, maintaining, storing, servicing or parking automobiles; or     if the person using the automobile violates any condition of this policy, or operates it in circumstances referred to in 7.2.2.    Examples    1. You allow a friend to use your car and she runs into a fire hydrant and damages the car.  We will pay for repairs and will not sue her to recover the money.    2. You hand over your car to a parking attendant or garage employee. He scratches the side while parking it. We will pay for repairs and recover from the garage owners because they had your automobile in connection with their business.    3. You allow a friend to use your car. Later, without your knowledge, he drives it while impaired by alcohol and hits a tree.  We will pay for the repairs to the car, but we will recover from your friend.  Driving while impaired is illegal and a violation of the terms of this policy.    7.4.3 Temporary Substitute Automobile Covered    If you or anyone else drives a temporary substitute automobile (described in Section 2), you may be responsible for any damage to it as a result of liability imposed by law or agreed to by you or the driver.  In that case, we will pay for direct damage for which you or the driver are legally responsible, minus the deductible for that peril under this policy.    However, if the owner of the substitute automobile has it insured for such losses, and the deductible on that policy is larger than the one on your own policy for such loss, the most we will pay will be the difference between the two deductibles.    If there is a disagreement over who is responsible for the damage, we have the right just as we would under Section 3 - Liability Coverage, to settle the matter appropriately and we will cover the costs of any investigation, negotiation or lawsuit.

While driving the rental car, you cause $2,800 worth of damage to it. The rental company has a collision policy with a $1,000 deductible. The Collision deductible in your policy is only $500. In settling the matter, we will pay $500, the difference between the deductibles.    7.4.4 Loss of Use Due to Theft    If a described automobile is stolen, and you are protected by the All Perils, Comprehensive, or Specified Perils options, we will pay reasonable expenses for the rental of a similar substitute automobile.    If you choose not to rent an automobile, we will pay reasonable expenses incurred for taxis or public transportation.    We won’t cover these costs until 72 hours after the theft has been reported to us or to the police. Even if your policy expires after the theft, coverage will continue until your automobile is repaired or replaced, or sooner if money is offered to settle the claim.     The most we will pay in either case for such expenses is $900.     7.5 Your and Other Insured Persons' Responsibilities    When making a claim under this Section, you and other insured persons must:     notify us in writing within seven days of the incident (or, if unable because of incapacity, as soon as possible after that), giving us the best information available at that time concerning the loss or damage and circumstances.     do as much as is reasonably possible to protect the automobile from further damage.

If we choose to do this, we will let you or other insured persons know in writing within seven days of receiving notice of the claim.  We will complete the work within a reasonable time using parts of similar kind and quality.    7.7 What We Will Pay    We will not pay more for the automobile than its actual cash value at the time it was damaged or stolen, less the deductible shown in your Certificate of Automobile Insurance.    The value of the loss or damage is also based on actual cash value after taking into account depreciation. We will not pay more to repair the automobile than its actual cash value at the time it was damaged or stolen, less the deductible.
