a written request that the amount of loss be set 
by appraisal. If either you, any insured or we 
make a written request for appraisal that is 
accepted, each shall select a competent, 
independent appraiser and notify the other of 
the appraiser's identity within 20 calendar days 
of receipt of the request.   
The two appraisers shall then select a 
competent, 
impartial 
umpire. 
If 
the 
two 
appraisers are unable to agree upon an umpire 
within 15 calendar days, you or we can 
request a judge of the court of the state in

agreed upon shall be the amount of the loss. If 
the appraisers fail to agree within a reasonable 
time, they shall submit their differences to the 
umpire. A written award signed by any two of

principal on the mortgage plus any accrued

Recovered Property  If you or we recover any property for which we

retained by you, our loss payment will be 
adjusted based on the amount of the payment 
we made for the recovered property.  16. 
Your Duty to Select and Maintain Policy Limits  At each policy renewal date, the amount of the 
limit of liability stated in the declarations for 
COVERAGE A may be adjusted to account for 
inflation, current building costs, changes in the 
cost of items of property and other factors. Any 
adjustment of the amount of the COVERAGE A 
limit of liability will result in proportionate 
adjustments of the amounts of limits of liability 
of 
COVERAGE 
B, 
COVERAGE 
C 
and 
COVERAGE D, and the amounts of the limits 
of liability of those OTHER COVERAGES – 
SECTION I, for which the limits of liability are a 
percentage of the COVERAGE A limit.   
It is your duty, however, to select and maintain 
adequate amounts of insurance.   
Any adjustment in the limits of liability listed 
above do not, in any way, represent, warrant, 
or guarantee that these adjustments will 
accurately account for inflation or that the 
amounts of coverage are adequate to repair or 
replace the damaged or destroyed property.

represent you. If any insured retains a lawyer

this coverage, we will not pay the fees and 
costs charged by that lawyer. Our duty to 
defend ends when the amount we pay for 
damages resulting from one occurrence 
equals our limit of liability, including depositing 
funds into the court. We have no duty to defend 
any insured in any criminal action or 
proceeding in which the recovery of a fine, 
penalty or restitution is sought.  3.

immediately 
adjoining;  b. is caused by the activities of any insured;  c. is caused by a residence employee in the

Severability of Insurance  This insurance applies separately to each 
insured, however, this condition will not 
increase our limit of liability for any one 
occurrence.   
This severability of insurance provision in no 
way alters or affects any provision of the policy 
indicating that it applies to “any insured”. Any 
limiting or exclusionary provision in the policy 
indicating that it applies to “any insured” 
means that such limiting or exclusionary 
provision is applicable as to any insured under 
this policy. Where we use the phrase “any 
insured”, we intend that such provisions not be 
limited to any one insured and that such 
provisions are applicable to any insured under 
the policy.  7. 
Suits Against Us  We may not be sued until all terms of this 
policy have been fully compiled with. In 
addition, under COVERAGE E, legal action 
may not be brought against us until the 
obligation to pay, by any insured, is finally 
determined either by:  a. judgment against the insured after actual 
trial; or  b. written agreement of the insured, the 
claimant and us.  No one has the right to bring us into a suit to 
determine the liability of any insured.

GUIDE TO THIS POLICY   
This is your Commercial Property Policy, a legal 
document which sets out the insurance cover you have 
requested and which we have agreed to provide.    Like most commercial policies, the language of this 
Policy is quite formal.  Please read it carefully, including 
the Schedule, and ensure you understand it fully.  Please 
contact your insurance broker immediately if anything 
needs correcting, or if anything is not clear to you.  The Policy has separate sections for the different types of 
cover you may have purchased.  In each section is an 
insuring clause which, with any Extensions, set out the 
initial scope of cover.  Then there are Exceptions, which 
exclude certain elements of that cover.  Finally there are 
Conditions, which contain important provisions which 
you should comply with in order to avoid potential 
problems.  The policy has a “private dictionary” – words with a 
special meaning are listed in alphabetical order in the 
definitions section, and those words always appear with a 
capital letter.  Also, there are some extensions, exceptions 
and conditions that apply to more than one Section, and 
to enable you to find the relevant clauses there are 
signposts where necessary.  CONTENTS

which the Declared Value bears to the cost of 
Reinstatement of the Property Insured;  (v) The Company will not pay under this clause;  (a) Until the Insured has incurred the cost of 
replacing or repairing the property;  (b) If the Insured or an agent of the Insured 
has insured the property under another

connection with the Business, has suffered Damage and 
as a result the Business carried on by the Insured is 
interrupted or interfered with, the Company will pay to 
the Insured in respect of each Item as stated in the 
Schedule the amount of loss resulting from such 
interruption or interference as calculated in accordance 
with the Basis of Cover Applicable to Section 2.  Provided that:  1. 
at the time of the Damage, there shall be in force an 
insurance covering the Premises against such 
Damage and:  (a) payment has been made or liability shall have 
been admitted; or,  (b) liability would have been admitted but for the

SECTION 2  1. Gross Profit including Increase in Cost of 
Working – Declaration Linked Basis  Cover under this Item is limited to loss of Gross 
Profit due to reduction in Turnover and increase in 
cost of working and the amount payable shall be 
calculated as follows:   (a) in respect of reduction in Turnover, the sum 
produced by applying the Rate of Gross Profit 
to the amount by which the Turnover during 
the Indemnity Period shall, as a result of the 
Incident, fall short of the Standard Turnover;  Rate of Gross Profit and Standard Turnover 
shall be adjusted as may be necessary to provide 
for the trend of the Business and for variations 
in or other circumstances affecting the Business, 
either before or after the Incident, which would 
have affected the Business had the Incident not 
occurred so that the figures thus adjusted shall 
represent as nearly as may be reasonably 
practicable the results which but for the 
Incident would have been obtained during the 
relative period after the Incident; 
  
(b) in respect of the increase in cost of working, the 
additional 
expenditure 
necessarily 
and 
reasonably incurred for the sole purpose of 
avoiding or diminishing the reduction in 
Turnover that, but for that expenditure, would 
have taken place during the Indemnity Period as 
a result of the Incident, but not exceeding the 
sum produced by applying the Rate of Gross 
Profit to the amount of the reduction thereby 
avoided, subject to the Uninsured Standing 
Charges Condition;   less any sums saved during the Indemnity Period in 
respect of the charges and expenses of the Business 
payable out of Gross Profit that are not incurred or 
are reduced as a result of the Incident.  The liability of the Company shall not exceed in 
respect of Gross Profit 133.33% of the Declared 
Value stated in the Schedule nor in the whole the 
sum of 133.33% of the Declared Value for Gross 
Profit and 100% of the Limit of Indemnity by other 
Items.   2. Additional Increase in Cost of Working  Cover under this Item is limited to such further 
additional expenditure beyond that recoverable 
under clause (b) of Item No 1 on Gross Profit as the 
Insured shall necessarily and reasonably incur during

the purpose of avoiding or diminishing the 
reduction in Turnover.

amount that would have been payable under (a) 
above if no such increase had occurred;  less any sum saved during the Indemnity Period in

value of such electronic data to the Insured or any 
other party even if such electronic data cannot be 
recreated gathered or assembled.  12. Deductibles  All claims under this Policy for loss arising out of

POLICY INTRODUCTION  The Contract of Insurance 
Your Policy is a contract between Us, the insurers, and You, 
the Policyholder. 
In return for You having paid or agreed to pay the premium, 
We will indemnify You by payment or, at Our option, by 
reinstatement or repair, in respect of loss, destruction, 
damage, accident or injury occurring or other insured 
contingency arising during the Period of Insurance, subject to 
the terms conditions and exclusions contained in the Policy 
and endorsed on The Schedule.  Important 
You are required to make a fair presentation of the risk to Us. 
If You breach Your duty to provide a fair presentation and any 
such breach was deliberate or reckless, We may regard the 
Policy as void and are not required to return any paid Premium 
to You. 
If the breach was not deliberate or reckless, Our remedy shall 
depend upon what We would have done if You had complied 
with the duty of fair presentation: 
1. We may regard the Policy as void if Insurers would not 
have entered into the Policy on any terms in the absence of 
the breach. In this case, We must return the premium paid. 
2. If We would have entered into the Policy, but on different 
terms (other than terms relating to premium) the Policy is to 
be treated as if those different terms applied from the 
outset, if We so require. 
3. If We would have entered into the Policy but would have 
charged a higher premium We may reduce proportionately 
the amount to be paid on a claim (and, if applicable, the 
amount already paid on prior claims) 
Choice of Law 
1. This Policy will be governed by English Law, and You and 
We agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the 
courts of England and Wales (unless You live in Jersey in 
which case the law of Jersey will apply and the Jersey 
courts will have exclusive jurisdiction).

choice of arbitrator the Law Society may be asked to make a 
nomination.  The arbitration will be binding and carried out under the 
Arbitration Act.  The costs of the arbitration will be at the discretion of 
the arbitrator.

Breach is deliberate or reckless

Cover under this policy is based on laws and regulations in 
force at the time that it was written. If We believe that any 
subsequent change in law or regulations results in the scope of 
cover being either restricted or broadened, We reserve the right 
to accept claims where the change restricts the cover under this 
policy and reject claims where the change provides a benefit 
which did not previously exist.    CUSTOMER SERVICES INFORMATION  
How to Make a Claim    Claims must be notified to the Claims Line 45 days of the Insured  
Event.  Failure to notify the claim within this time will invalidate the

issued.

may nominate another solicitor to act for You.  You can use the helpline service to discuss any legal problem 
occurring within the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the

or circumstance, You should contact the legal advice line for 
assistance.  Claims Line

appropriate, an Enquiry Agent will visit the Tenant and any 
Guarantor. If the Enquiry Agent is unable to reach an 
agreement with the Tenant/Guarantor to remedy his failure 
to perform his obligations under the Tenancy Agreement, 
Our panel solicitors or their agents will be appointed to act 
for You.  Any Rent arrears covered under the insurance will 
generally be paid within 21 days from the end of the rental

PROPERTY OWNERS INSURANCE 
40      POLICY CONDITIONS 
Each Section of the Policy contains Conditions.  They must be 
read in conjunction with the following Policy Conditions which 
apply to all Sections, other than Legal Expenses Insurance 
Section, unless otherwise stated. 
Where: (i) there has been a failure to comply with a term (express 
or implied) of this Policy, other than a term which defines the risk 
as a whole; and (ii) compliance with such term would tend to 
reduce the risk of loss of a particular kind and/or loss at a 
particular location and/or loss at a particular time, We cannot rely 
on the breach of such term to exclude, limit or discharge its 
liability if You show that the failure to comply with such term 
could not have increased the risk of the loss which actually 
occurred in the circumstances in which it occurred. 
If You breach any warranty in this Policy, Our liability under the 
Policy shall be suspended from the time of the breach until the 
time when the breach is remedied (if it is capable of being 
remedied). We will have no liability to You for any loss which 
occurs, or which is attributable to something happening, during 
the period when Our liability is suspended  (1) Alteration of risk 
If (a) there has been any alteration to the Property Insured 
and, or The Premises and, or The Business after the 
effective date of this insurance which increases the risk 
of loss, liability, destruction, damage, accident or injury 
or  (b)  Your interest ceases except by will or operation of law  We will at Our option avoid the Policy from the date of such 
alteration or when Your interest ceases.  (2) Arbitration 
If We accept liability but You disagree with the amount We offer to 
pay, the claim will be referred to an arbitrator who will be 
appointed in accordance with statutory provisions.  (3) Cancellation 
Following the expiry of Your Statutory 14 day right to cancel (also 
known as the “cooling-off period”), You continue to have the right 
to cancel Your policy at any time during its term. 
If You do cancel Your Policy after the “cooling-off period”, You 
will be entitled to a refund of the premium You paid subject to a 
deduction for the time for which You have been covered. This will 
be calculated in proportion to the period for which You have been 
on cover.  If You wish to cancel Your Policy at any time, please contact 
Your insurance adviser.  We may cancel the Policy 
(a) by sending You 30 days written notice to Your last known 
address 
We will refund a proportionate part of the premium paid 
for the unexpired period, provided that no claims  have 
been paid or are outstanding during the Period of 
Insurance. 
(b) immediately if the premium has not been paid or if there 
has been a default under an instalment or linked credit 
agreement. 
We will not refund any instalment paid and at Our discretion may 
request full payment of the annual premium if any claims have 
been paid or are outstanding during the Period of Insurance.  Other reasons for cancellation under this Condition may include 
but are not limited to: 
(a) a change to the risk which makes it one We would not 
normally accept 
(b) You failing to co-operate with or provide information to Us 
which affects Our ability to underwrite the risk.   
(4) Contribution 
Applicable to the Employers’ Liability Section and Property 
Owners Liability Section 
(a) If the insurance provided by these Sections is also covered 
by another Policy (or would be but for the existence of these 
Sections), We will only indemnify You in respect of any 
excess beyond the amount which would be payable under 
such other insurance had these Sections not been effected.  Applicable to all other Sections insured by this Policy other 
than Legal Expenses Insurance Section 
(b) Where any loss, destruction, damage or liability covered by 
the Policy is also covered by another Policy, (or would be 
but for the existence of this Policy), We will only pay a 
rateable share of the loss. 
(c) If the other insurance is subject to a condition of Average 
and this Policy is not, this Policy will become subject to the 
same condition of Average. 
(d) If the Property Insured covered by the other insurance is 
subject to a provision excluding proportional payment in 
whole or in part, the payment We make will be limited to 
the proportion of loss, destruction or damage as the Sum 
Insured bears to the value of the property.  (5) Discharge of Liability 
We may at any time pay 
(a) the Limit of Indemnity 
or 
(b) the Sum Insured 
or 
(c) a smaller amount for which a claim can be settled, after 
deduction of any sum already paid.  We will not be liable for any further payment except for costs and 
expenses incurred prior to the payment of the claim with Our 
consent.  (6) Fraud 
If You make a fraudulent claim under this Policy We shall not be 
liable to pay You any sums in respect of the fraudulent claim. 
We may recover from You any sums that the We have already 
paid to You in respect of the fraudulent claim.

Successful the Insurer will pay the fees and expenses of the independent expert. However, if the 
independent expert agrees with the Insurer that there are no reasonable prospects of the Insured being 
Successful the fees and expenses of the independent expert shall be shared equally between the Insured 
and the Insurer. 
2. Appointed Representative 
In the event that the Insurer agrees to pay Legal Expenses on the Insured’s behalf to pursue a claim under 
this Section and the Insured and the Insurer subsequently agree that it is necessary for the Insured to instruct 
an Appointed Representative, the Insured has the right to choose their Appointed Representative with the 
Claims Manager’s prior written agreement (which will not be unreasonably withheld). 
Prior to the Insurer providing written agreement for an Appointed Representative to act on the Insured’s 
behalf, the Insurer will consider whether, in the opinion of the Insured’s Appointed Representative, it is 
reasonable for the Insured to pursue their legal rights taking into consideration a reasonable estimate of the 
total Legal Expenses and there are reasonable prospects of the Insured being Successful. 
The Claims Managers will monitor the progress of a claim under this section. If at any time during the 
progress of the claim, the Insured’s Appointed Representative’s opinion changes so that the likelihood of 
succeeding in the claim are less than 50%, the Insurer reserves the right to withdraw its agreement to pay 
further Legal Expenses for the pursuit or defence of the claim. 
If the Insurer withdraws agreement to pay further Legal Expenses or for the pursuit of any claim but the 
Insured continues to pursue or defend the claim at their own expense and are Successful in the pursuit of the 
claim, the Insurer will reimburse those reasonable Legal Expenses incurred by the Insured from the date that 
the agreement was withdrawn up until the final conclusion of the claim.    3. Information documentation or advice 
The Insured must give the Appointed Representative all necessary assistance, documentation and 
information including a complete truthful account of the facts of the case and all relevant documentary or 
other evidence in the Insured’s possession. The Insured must search for, provide, obtain, sign or execute all 
documents as required by the relevant court or tribunal rules or as recommended by the Appointed 
Representative and attend all meetings or conferences as requested. Cover may be withdrawn if the Insured 
fails to co-operate at all or within a reasonable time with the Appointed Representative’s request. 
The Claims Manager is entitled to receive from the Appointed Representative any information, document or 
advice in connection with any claim or legal proceedings even if such material is legally privileged. On request 
the Insured will give to the Appointed Representative any instructions necessary to secure the required 
access.  4. Invoice payments 
The Insured shall be responsible for the payment of Legal Expenses invoices. The Insurer will, however, 
settle these direct with the Appointed Representative if requested to do so by the Insured. All invoices must 
be certified by the Claims Manager to the effect that all charges have been properly incurred. Only invoices in 
respect of Legal Expenses incurred with the written consent of the Claims Manager and in the amount agreed 
with the Claims Manager shall be paid.  5. Recovery of Costs 
Whenever the Insured is awarded costs or costs are included under the terms of any settlement, those costs 
are to be repaid to the Insurer. In every claim the Insured and the Appointed Representative shall make every 
effort to make a full recovery of costs. Where a settlement purports to be a global or a without costs 
settlement, the Insured agrees that the Appointed Representative’s appraisal of a fair and reasonable 
proportion of that settlement will be deemed costs and shall be due to the Insurer.  6. Resist or pursue appeals 
If, the Insured wishes to appeal against the judgement or a decision of the court or tribunal in legal 
proceedings the grounds of that appeal must be submitted to the Claims Manager for its prior written consent 
to incur Legal Expenses in that appeal. 
If the appeal is lodged against the judgement or decision of the court or tribunal made in favour of the Insured 
in legal proceedings which were previously consented to by the Claims Manager, the Claims Manager must 
be informed immediately and its written consent must be obtained for cover to continue. Where the Insurer 
wish to pursue or resist an appeal against the judgement or decision of the court or tribunal, the Insured must 
co-operate with the Appointed Representative.
