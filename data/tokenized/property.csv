Please contact your insurance broker immediately if anything needs correcting, or if anything is not clear to you.    The Policy has separate sections for the different types of cover you may have purchased.  In each section is an insuring clause which, with any Extensions, set out the initial scope of cover.

In return for You having paid or agreed to pay the premium, We will indemnify You by payment or, at Our option, by reinstatement or repair, in respect of loss, destruction, damage, accident or injury occurring or other insured contingency arising during the Period of Insurance, subject to the terms conditions and exclusions contained in the Policy and endorsed on The Schedule.    Important You are required to make a fair presentation of the risk to Us. If You breach Your duty to provide a fair presentation and any such breach was deliberate or reckless, We may regard the Policy as void and are not required to return any paid Premium to You. If the breach was not deliberate or reckless, Our remedy shall depend upon what We would have done if You had complied with the duty of fair presentation: 1. We may regard the Policy as void if Insurers would not have entered into the Policy on any terms in the absence of the breach. In this case, We must return the premium paid. 2. If We would have entered into the Policy, but on different terms (other than terms relating to premium) the Policy is to be treated as if those different terms applied from the outset, if We so require. 3. If We would have entered into the Policy but would have charged a higher premium We may reduce proportionately the amount to be paid on a claim (and, if applicable, the amount already paid on prior claims) Choice of Law 1. This Policy will be governed by English Law, and You and We agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales (unless You live in Jersey in which case the law of Jersey will apply and the Jersey courts will have exclusive jurisdiction).
